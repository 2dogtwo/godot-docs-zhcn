msgid "Godot offers a first-party ``GodotGooglePlayBilling`` Android plugin compatible with Godot 3.2.2 and higher. This plugin uses the `Google Play Billing library <https://developer.android.com/google/play/billing>`__ instead of the now deprecated AIDL IAP implementation. For details of how to migrate from the older ``GodotPaymentsV3``, see the migration guide: `Migrating from Godot 3.2.1 and lower (GodotPaymentsV3)`_."
