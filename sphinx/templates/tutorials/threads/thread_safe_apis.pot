msgid ":ref:`Global Scope<class_@GlobalScope>` singletons are all thread safe. Accessing servers from threads is supported (for VisualServer and Physics servers, ensure threaded or thread safe operation is enabled in the project settings!)."

msgid "This makes them ideal for code that creates dozens of thousands of instances in servers and controls them from threads. Of course, it requires a bit more code, as this is used directly and not within the scene tree."

msgid "Interacting with the active scene tree is **NOT** thread safe. Make sure to use mutexes when sending data between threads. If you want to call functions from a thread, the *call_deferred* function may be used:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/threads/thread_safe_apis.rst:33
msgid "However, creating scene chunks (nodes in tree arrangement) outside the active tree is fine. This way, parts of a scene can be built or instantiated in a thread, then added in the main thread:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/threads/thread_safe_apis.rst:42
msgid "Still, this is only really useful if you have **one** thread loading data. Attempting to load or create scene chunks from multiple threads may work, but you risk resources (which are only loaded once in Godot) tweaked by the multiple threads, resulting in unexpected behaviors or crashes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/threads/thread_safe_apis.rst:47
msgid "Only use more than one thread to generate scene data if you *really* know what you are doing and you are sure that a single resource is not being used or set in multiple ones. Otherwise, you are safer just using the servers API (which is fully thread-safe) directly and not touching scene or resources."
