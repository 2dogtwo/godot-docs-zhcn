#: ../../docs/tutorials/io/data_paths.rst:29
msgid "While the project is running, it is a common scenario that the resource path will be read-only, due to it being inside a package, self-contained executable, or system-wide install location."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/io/data_paths.rst:33
msgid "Storing persistent files in such scenarios should be done by using the ``user://`` prefix, for example: ``user://game_save.txt``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/io/data_paths.rst:36
msgid "On some devices (for example, mobile and consoles), this path is unique to the project. On desktop operating systems, the engine uses the typical ``~/.local/share/godot/app_userdata/Name`` on macOS and Linux, and ``%APPDATA%/Name`` on Windows. ``Name`` is taken from the application name defined in the Project Settings, but it can be overridden on a per-platform basis using :ref:`feature tags <doc_feature_tags>`."

This will make Godot write all user data to a directory named ``editor_data/`` in the same directory as the editor binary.
