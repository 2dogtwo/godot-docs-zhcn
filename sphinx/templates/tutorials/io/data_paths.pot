msgid "This page explains how file paths work inside Godot projects. You will learn how to access paths in your projects using the ``res://`` and ``user://`` notations and where Godot stores user files on your hard-drive."

#: ../../docs/tutorials/io/data_paths.rst:22
msgid "Godot considers that a project exists in any folder that contains a ``project.godot`` text file, even if the file is empty. The folder that contains this file is your project's root folder."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/io/data_paths.rst:26
msgid "You can access any file relative to it by writing paths starting with ``res://``, which stands for resources. For example, you can access an image file ``character.png`` located in the project's root folder in code with the following path: ``res://some_texture.png``."

msgid "Accessing persistent user data"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/io/data_paths.rst:34
msgid "To store persistent data files, like the player's save or settings, you want to use ``user://`` instead of ``res://`` as your path's prefix. This is because when the game is running, the project's file system will likely be read-only."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/io/data_paths.rst:38
msgid "The ``user://`` prefix points to a different directory on the user's device. On mobile and consoles, this path is unique to the project. On desktop, the engine stores user files in ``~/.local/share/godot/app_userdata/[project_name]`` on Linux, ``~/Library/Application Support/Godot/app_userdata/[project_name]`` on macOS (since Catalina) and ``%APPDATA%\\Godot\\app_userdata\\[project_name]`` on Windows. ``[project_name]`` is based on the application name defined in the Project Settings, but you can override it on a per-platform basis using :ref:`feature tags <doc_feature_tags>`."

#: ../../docs/tutorials/io/data_paths.rst:46
msgid "On HTML5 exports, ``user://`` will refer to a virtual filesystem stored on the device via IndexedDB. (Interaction with the main filesystem can still be performed through the :ref:`JavaScript <class_JavaScript>` singleton.)"
