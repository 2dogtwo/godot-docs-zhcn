msgid "Godot considers that a project exists in any folder that contains a ``project.godot`` text file, even if the file is empty. The folder that contains this file is your project's root folder."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/io/data_paths.rst:26
msgid "You can access any file relative to it by writing paths starting with ``res://``, which stands for resources. For example, you can access an image file ``character.png`` located in the project's root folder in code with the following path: ``res://some_texture.png``."

msgid "Accessing persistent user data"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/io/data_paths.rst:34
msgid "To store persistent data files, like the player's save or settings, you want to use ``user://`` instead of ``res://`` as your path's prefix. This is because when the game is running, the project's file system will likely be read-only."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/io/data_paths.rst:38
msgid "The ``user://`` prefix points to a different directory on the user's device. On mobile and consoles, this path is unique to the project. On desktop, the engine stores user files in ``~/.local/share/godot/app_userdata/Name`` on macOS and Linux, and ``%APPDATA%/Name`` on Windows. ``Name`` is based on the application name defined in the Project Settings, but you can override it on a per-platform basis using :ref:`feature tags <doc_feature_tags>`."
