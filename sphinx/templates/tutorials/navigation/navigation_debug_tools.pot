msgid "Different navigation meshes connected within ``edge_connection_margin`` distance are overlaid. The color of the overlay is controlled with the navigation debug ``edge_connection_color``.

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/navigation/navigation_debug_tools.rst:70
msgid "NavigationProcess shows how long the NavigationServer spends updating its internals this update frame in milliseconds. NavigationProcess works similar to Process for visual frame rendering and PhysicsProcess for collision and fixed updates."

#: ../../docs/tutorials/navigation/navigation_debug_tools.rst:73
msgid "NavigationProcess accounts for all updates to ``navigation maps``, ``navigation regions`` and ``navigation agents`` as well as all the ``avoidance calculations`` for the update frame."

msgid "NavigationProcess does NOT include pathfinding performance cause pathfinding operates on the navigation map data independently from the server process update."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/navigation/navigation_debug_tools.rst:79
msgid "NavigationProcess should be in general kept as low and as stable as possible for runtime performance to avoid frame rate issues. Note that since the NavigationServer process update happens in the middle of the physics update an increase in NavigationProcess will automatically increase PhysicsProcess by the same amount."

msgid "Navigation statistics shown here can not be judged as good or bad for performance as it depends entirely on the project what can be considered as reasonable or horribly excessive."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/navigation/navigation_debug_tools.rst:88
msgid "Navigation statistics help with identifying performance bottlenecks that are less obvious because the source might not always have a visible representation. E.g. pathfinding performance issues created by overly detailed navigation meshes with thousand of edges / polygons or problems caused by procedural navigation gone wrong."
