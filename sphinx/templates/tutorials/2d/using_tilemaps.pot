msgid "A tilemap is a grid of tiles used to create a game's layout. There are several benefits to using :ref:`TileMap <class_TileMap>` nodes to design your levels. First, they make it possible to draw the layout by \"painting' the tiles onto a grid, which is much faster than placing individual :ref:`Sprite <class_Sprite>` nodes one by one. Second, they allow for much larger levels because they are optimized for drawing large numbers of tiles. Finally, you can add collision, occlusion, and navigation shapes to tiles, adding additional functionality to the TileMap."

Godot's default is to import 2D images using an interpolated \"filter\" mode, which will result in ugly borders between the tiles. Select the image and click the Import tab. Turn off ``Filter`` and click \"Reimport\". See :ref:`doc_import_images` for details."
