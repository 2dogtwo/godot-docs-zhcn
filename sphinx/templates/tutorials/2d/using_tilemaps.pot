msgid "Tilemaps can be used to make levels for 2D games. A tilemap is a grid of (usually square) image tiles which form the scenery of a level or area in a game. The placed tiles in a tilemap are instances of 'reference tiles' from a tileset. The tileset can be thought of as a pallete with which a tilemap (level) can be 'painted':"

msgid "Here are some tiles for a tileset. They are all part of the same image file. This is helpful for a game's performance. There are so-called *texture packers* that will generate these spritesheets out of several separate tile images. But keeping them as separate images also works."

msgid "Create a new scene with a regular Node or Node2D as root. For each reference tile you want to define, add a sprite node as a child. Since our tiles measure 50x50 pixels, you should turn on the grid (``View -> Show Grid`` or ``G`` key) and enable snap (``Use Snap`` icon or ``Shift + S`` keys). Moving tiles with the mouse might still be inaccurate, so use your arrow keys as well."

msgid "Edit the polygon; this will give the tile a collision shape and remove the warning icon next to the CollisionPolygon node. **Remember to use snap!** Using snap will make sure collision polygons are aligned properly, allowing a character to walk seamlessly from tile to tile. Also **do not scale or move** the collision and/or collision polygon nodes. Leave them at offset 0,0, with scale 1,1 and rotation 0 with respect to the parent sprite."

The default value of 16 means that the engine will draw and cull (erase) the tilemap in blocks of 16x16 tiles. This value is usually fine, but can be used to fine tune performance in specific cases if you know what you're doing."

Icons at the top right of the editor allow flipping and rotating of the currently selected sprite - you can also use the A and S keys to flip the sprite horizontally and vertically. With a brick pattern like this tutorial uses, flipping the sprites would create unpleasant discontinuities unless you're flipping an entire region of bricks. But for some kinds of tiles, flipping can be a convenient and space-saving feature."
