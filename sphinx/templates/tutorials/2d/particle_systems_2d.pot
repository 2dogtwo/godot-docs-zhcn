msgid "The idea is that a \"particle\" is emitted at a fixed interval and with a fixed lifetime. During its lifetime, every particle will have the same base behavior. What makes each particle different from the rest and provides a more organic look is the \"randomness\" associated with each parameter. In essence, creating a particle system means setting base physics parameters and then adding randomness to them."

msgid "Godot provides two different nodes for 2D particles, :ref:`class_GPUParticles2D` and :ref:`class_CPUParticles2D`. GPUParticles2D is more advanced and uses the GPU to process particle effects. CPUParticles2D is a CPU-driven option with near-feature parity with GPUParticles2D, but lower performance when using large amounts of particles. On the other hand, CPUParticles2D may perform better on low-end systems or in GPU-bottlenecked situations."
