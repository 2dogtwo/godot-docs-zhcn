To create a smaller APK, uncheck either **Armeabi-v 7a** or **Arm 64 -v 8a** in your project's Android export preset. This will create an APK that only contains a library for a single architecture.

To solve this, you can upload several APKs to Google Play using its `Multiple APK support <https://developer.android.com/google/play/publishing/multiple-apks>`__. Each APK should target a single architecture; creating an APK for ARMv7 and ARMv8 is usually sufficient to cover most devices in use today."
