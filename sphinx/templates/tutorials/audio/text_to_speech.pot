msgid "Godot depends on system libraries for text-to-speech functionality. These libraries are installed by default on Windows and macOS, but not on all Linux distributions. If they are not present, text-to-speech functionality will not work. Specifically, the ``tts_get_voices()`` method will return an empty list, indicating that there are no usable voices."

msgid "The best practices for text-to-speech, in terms of the ideal player experience for blind players, is to send output to the player's screen reader. This preserves the choice of language, speed, pitch, etc. that the user set, as well as allows advanced features like allowing players to scroll backward and forward through text. As of now, Godot doesn't provide this level of integration."

This is especially critical on Android and Web, where some of the voices depend on web services, and the actual time to playback depends on server load, network latency, and other factors."
