msgid ":ref:`Gridmaps <class_GridMap>` are a tool for creating 3D game levels, similar to the way :ref:`TileMap <doc_using_tilemaps>` works in 2D. You start with a predefined collection of 3D meshes (a :ref:`class_MeshLibrary`) that can be placed on a grid, as if you were building a level with an unlimited amount of Lego blocks."

msgid "To begin, you need a :ref:`class_MeshLibrary`, which is a collection of individual meshes that can be used in the gridmap. Open the \"MeshLibrary_Source.tscn\" scene to see an example of how to set up the mesh library."
msgstr ""

msgid "As you can see, this scene has a :ref:`class_Spatial` node as its root, and a number of :ref:`class_MeshInstance` node children."

msgid "If you don't need any physics in your scene, then you're done. However, in most cases you'll want to assign collision bodies to the meshes."

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/3d/using_gridmaps.rst:51
msgid "Note that a \"Convex\" collision body will work better for simple meshes. For more complex shapes, select \"Create Trimesh Static Body\". Once each mesh has a physics body and collision shape assigned, your mesh library is ready to be used."
