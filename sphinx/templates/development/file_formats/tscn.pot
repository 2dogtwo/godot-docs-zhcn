msgid "The TSCN (text scene) file format represents a single scene tree inside Godot. TSCN files have the advantage of being mostly human-readable and easy for version control systems to manage. During import, TSCN files are compiled into binary ``.scn`` files stored inside the .import folder. This reduces the data size and speeds up loading."
