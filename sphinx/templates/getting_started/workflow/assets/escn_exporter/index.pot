msgid "If you have hundreds of model files, you don't want your artists to waste time manually exporting their blend files. To combat this, the exporter provides a python function ``io_scene_godot.export(out_file_path)`` that can be called to export a file. This allows easy integration with other build systems. An example Makefile and python script that exports all the blends in a directory is present in the Godot-Blender-exporter repository."
