msgid "Godot offers a more elegant approach for PC distribution when using the export system. When exporting for PC (Linux, Windows, macOS), the exporter takes all the project files and creates a ``data.pck`` file. This file is bundled with a specially optimized binary that is smaller, faster and does not contain the editor and debugger."

msgid "On Windows, PCK embedding is also known to cause false positives in antivirus programs. Therefore, it's recommended to avoid using it unless you're distributing your project via Steam as it bypasses code signing and antivirus checks."
