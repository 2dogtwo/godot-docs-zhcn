msgid "With typed GDScript, Godot can detect even more errors as you write code! It gives you and your teammates more information as you’re working, as the arguments’ types show up when you call a method."

msgid "Imagine you’re programming an inventory system. You code an ``Item`` node, then an ``Inventory``. To add items to the inventory, the people who work with your code should always pass an ``Item`` to the ``Inventory.add`` method. With types, you can enforce this:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/scripting/gdscript/static_typing.rst:48
msgid "Another significant advantage of typed GDScript is the new **warning system**. From version 3.1, Godot gives you warnings about your code as you write it: the engine identifies sections of your code that may lead to issues at runtime, but lets you decide whether or not you want to leave the code as it is. More on that in a moment."

msgid "Overall, typed programming gives you a more structured experience. It helps prevent errors and improves the self-documenting aspect of your scripts. This is especially helpful when you’re working in a team or on a long-term project: studies have shown that developers spend most of their time reading other people’s code, or scripts they wrote in the past and forgot about. The clearer and the more structured the code, the faster it is to understand, the faster you can move forward."
