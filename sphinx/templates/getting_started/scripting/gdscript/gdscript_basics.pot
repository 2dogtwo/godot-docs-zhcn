msgid "*GDScript* is a high-level, dynamically typed programming language used to create content. It uses a syntax similar to `Python <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29>`_ (blocks are indent-based and many keywords are similar). Its goal is to be optimized for and tightly integrated with Godot Engine, allowing great flexibility for content creation and integration."
