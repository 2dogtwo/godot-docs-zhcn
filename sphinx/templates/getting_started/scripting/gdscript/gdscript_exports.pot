msgid "In Godot, class members can be exported. This means their value gets saved along with the resource (such as the :ref:`scene <class_PackedScene>`) they're attached to. They will also be available for editing in the property editor. Exporting is done by using the ``export`` keyword::"

#: ../../docs/getting_started/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_exports.rst:18
msgid "An exported variable must be initialized to a constant expression or have an export hint in the form of an argument to the ``export`` keyword (see the *Examples* section below)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_exports.rst:22
msgid "One of the fundamental benefits of exporting member variables is to have them visible and editable in the editor. This way, artists and game designers can modify values that later influence how the program runs. For this, a special export syntax is provided."

msgid "Exporting properties can also be done in other languages such as C#. The syntax varies depending on the language."

msgid "Integers used as bit flags can store multiple ``true``/``false`` (boolean) values in one property. By using the export hint ``int, FLAGS``, they can be set from the editor::"

msgid "Restricting the flags to a certain number of named flags is also possible. The syntax is similar to the enumeration syntax::"

msgid "In this example, ``Fire`` has value 1, ``Water`` has value 2, ``Earth`` has value 4 and ``Wind`` corresponds to value 8. Usually, constants should be defined accordingly (e.g. ``const ELEMENT_WIND = 8`` and so on)."

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_exports.rst:160
msgid "Exporting arrays works, but with an important caveat: while regular arrays are created local to every class instance, exported arrays are *shared* between all instances. This means that editing them in one instance will cause them to change in all other instances. Exported arrays can have initializers, but they must be constant expressions."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_exports.rst:166
msgid "If the exported array specifies a type which inherits from Resource, the array values can be set in the inspector by dragging and dropping multiple files from the FileSystem dock at once."

msgid "When changing an exported variable's value from a script in :ref:`doc_gdscript_tool_mode`, the value in the inspector won't be updated automatically. To update it, call :ref:`property_list_changed_notify() <class_Object_method_property_list_changed_notify>` after setting the exported variable's value."
