msgid "Now that you have a working game, you probably want to share your success with others. However, it's not practical to ask your friends to download Godot just so they can open your project. Instead, you can *export* your project, converting it into a \"package\" that can be run by anyone."

msgid "The way you export your game depends on what platform you are targeting. In this tutorial, you'll learn how to export the \"Dodge the Creeps\" game for a variety of platforms. First, however, we need to make some changes to the way the game works."

msgid "In \"Dodge the Creeps\" we used keyboard controls to move the player's character. This is fine if your game is being played on a PC platform, but on a phone or tablet, you need to support touchscreen input. Because a click event can be treated the same as a touch event, we'll convert the game to a click-and-move input style."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/step_by_step/exporting.rst:31
msgid "The first step is to open \"Project Settings\" and find the *Handheld* section. Enable the *Emulate Touchscreen* option. This lets you treat mouse click events the same as touch events, so you can test the game on a computer without a touchscreen. Also, make sure to select \"portrait\" under *Orientation*."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/step_by_step/exporting.rst:36
msgid "In the *Stretch* section, set *Mode* to \"2d\" and *Aspect* to \"keep\". This ensures that the game scales consistently on different sized screens."
