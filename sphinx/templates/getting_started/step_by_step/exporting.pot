msgid "Now that you have a working game, you probably want to share your success with others. However, it's not practical to ask your friends to download Godot just so they can open your project. Instead, you can *export* your project, converting it into a \"package\" that can be run by anyone."

msgid "The way you export your game depends on what platform you are targeting. In this tutorial, you'll learn how to export the \"Dodge the Creeps\" game for a variety of platforms. First, however, we need to make some changes to the way the game works."

msgid "In \"Dodge the Creeps\" we used keyboard controls to move the player's character. This is fine if your game is being played on a PC platform, but on a phone or tablet, you need to support touchscreen input. Because a click event can be treated the same as a touch event, we'll convert the game to a click-and-move input style."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/step_by_step/exporting.rst:31
msgid "By default Godot emulates mouse input from touch input. That means if anything is coded to happen on a mouse event, touch will trigger it as well. Godot can also emulate touch input from mouse clicks, which we will need to be able to keep playing our game on our computer after we switch to touch input. In the \"Project Settings\" under *Input Devices* and *Pointing*, set *Emulate Touch From Mouse* to \"On\"."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/step_by_step/exporting.rst:39
msgid "We also want to ensure that the game scales consistently on different-sized screens, so in the project settings go to *Display*, then click on *Window*. In the *Stretch* options, set *Mode* to \"2d\" and *Aspect* to \"keep\"."
