"Godot offers two main means of creating types: scripts and scenes. Both of "
"these represent a \"class\" since Godot revolves around Object-Oriented "
"design. *How* they do this may not be clear to beginner or intermediate "
"users though."

"Godot Engine provides classes out-of-the-box (like :ref:`Node "
"<class_Node>`), but user-created types are not actually classes. Instead "
"they are resources that tell the engine a sequence of initializations to "
"perform on an engine class."

"Godot's internal classes have methods that register a class's data with a :"
"ref:`ClassDB <class_ClassDB>`. This database provides runtime access to "
"class information (also called \"reflection\"). Things stored in the ClassDB "

"Furthermore, this ClassDB is what Objects actually check against when "
"performing any operation. Access a property? Call a method? Emit a signal? "
"It will check the database's records (and the records of the Object's base "
"types) to see if the Object supports the operation. Every C++ Object defines "
"a static `_bind_methods()` function that describes what C++ content it "
"registers to the database and how."

"So, if the engine provides all of this data at startup, then how does a user "
"define their own data? It'd be nice if users could define a custom set of "
"data to be appended to an object's data. That way, users could inject their "
"own properties and methods into the engine's Object query requests."

"*This* is what a :ref:`Script <class_Script>` is. Objects check their "
"attached script before the database, so scripts can even override methods. "
"If a script defines a `_get_property_list()` method, that data is appended "
"to the list of properties the Object fetches from the ClassDB. The same "
"holds true for other declarative code."

msgid ""
"This can lead to some users' confusion when they see a script as being a "
"class unto itself. In reality, the engine just auto-instantiates the base "
"engine class and then adds the script to that object. This then allows the "
"Object to defer to the Script's content where the engine logic deems "
"appropriate."

"A problem does present itself though. As the size of Objects increases, the "
"scripts' necessary size to create them grows much, much larger. Creating "
"node hierarchies demonstrates this. Each individual Node's logic could be "
"several hundred lines of code in length."

msgid ""
"Notice that only two pieces of declarative code are involved in the creation "
"of this child node: the variable declaration and the constructor "
"declaration. Everything else about the child must be setup using imperative "
"code. However, script code is much slower than engine C++ code. Each change "
"must make a separate call to the scripting API which means a lot of C++ "
"\"lookups\" within data structures to find the corresponding logic to "
"execute."

"To help offload the work, it would be convenient if one could batch up all "
"operations involved in creating and setting up node hierarchies. The engine "
"could then handle the construction using its fast C++ code, and the script "
"code would be free from the perils of imperative code."

"*This* is what a scene (:ref:`PackedScene <class_PackedScene>`) is: a "

"Now, why is any of this important to scene organization? Because one must "
"understand that scenes *are* objects. One often pairs a scene with a "
"scripted root node that makes use of the sub-nodes. This means that the "
"scene is often an extension of the script's declarative code."

"As such, many Object-Oriented principles which apply to \"programming\", i."

"in one scene (which are often bundled into the scene itself). Other scripts "
