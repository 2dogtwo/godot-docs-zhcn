"2D and 3D version of the navigation mesh are available as :ref:"
"`NavigationPolygon<class_NavigationPolygon>` and :ref:"
"`NavigationMesh<class_NavigationMesh>`  respectively."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A navigation mesh describes the traversable safe area for an agent with its "
"center position at zero radius. If you want pathfinding to account for an "
"agent's (collision) size you need to shrink the navigation mesh accordingly."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Navigation works independent from other engine parts like rendering and "
"physics. A navigation mesh is the data format to exchange information from "
"those other systems as it describes the traversable safe area for a specific "
"agent. All the necessary information from other engine parts need to be "
"already factored in when creating a navigation mesh. E.g. like visuals that "
"an agent should not clip through or physics collision shapes that an agent "
"should not collide with. This process of factoring in all those wanted "
"navigation restrictions from other engine parts like visuals and collision "
"is commonly called navigation mesh baking."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you experience clipping or collision problems while following navigation "
"paths always remember that you need to tell the navigation system through an "
"appropriated navigation mesh what your intentions are. By itself the "
"navigation system will never know \"this is a tree / rock / wall collision "
"shape or visual mesh\" because it only knows \"here I was told I can path "
"safely cause it is on navigation mesh\"."

msgid "Creating 2D NavigationMeshes"
msgstr "Malhas de Navegação"

msgid ""
"Navigation meshes in the 2D editor are created with the help of the "
"NavigationPolygon draw tools that appear in the top bar of the editor when a "
"NavigationRegion2D is selected."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The NavigationPolygon draw tools can be used to create and edit navigation "
"meshes by defining ``outline`` polygons. The outline polygons are later "
"converted to real NavigationMesh resources for the NavigationServer regions."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Multiple outlines can be added to the same NavPolygon resource as long as "
"they **do not intersect or overlap**. Each additional outline will cut a "
"hole in the polygon created by the larger outline. If the larger polygon is "
"already a hole it will create a new navigation mesh polygon inside."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Outlines are not a replacement if the intention is to merge aligned polygons "
"e.g. from grid cells. Outlines, as the name would suggest, cannot intersect "
"each other or have any overlapping vertex positions."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Outline layouts like seen in this picture will fail the convex partitioning "
"required by the navigation mesh generation. In this layout cases the outline "
"tool cannot be used. Use the :ref:`Geometry2D<class_Geometry2D>` class for "
"polygon merge or intersect operations to create a valid merged mesh for "
"navigation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The NavigationServer does not connect navigation mesh islands from the same "
"NavigationMesh resource. Do not create multiple disconnected islands in the "
"same NavigationRegion2D and NavPoly resource if they should be later "
"connected."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For 2D no similar navigation mesh baking with geometry parsing exists like "
"in 3D. The Geometry2D class functions for offset, merge, intersect and clip "
"can be used to shrink or enlarge existing NavigationPolygons to different "
"actor sizes."

msgid "Creating 3D NavigationMeshes"
msgstr "Malhas de Navegação"

msgid ""
"Navigation meshes in the 3D editor are created with the help of the :ref:"
"`NavigationMeshGenerator<class_NavigationMeshGenerator>` singleton and the "
"NavigationMesh bake settings that appear in the editor inspector."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"NavigationMesh baking is the process of creating a simplified mesh used for "
"pathfinding out of (complex) 3D level geometry. For this process Godot "
"parses scene geometry and hands the raw mesh or collision data to the third-"
"party ReCast library for processing and creation of the final navigationmesh."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The resulting NavigationMesh is an approximation of the source geometry "
"surfaces for both performance and technical reasons. Do not expect the "
"NavigationMesh to perfectly follow the original surfaces. Especially "
"navigation polygons placed over ramps will not keep an equal distance to the "
"ground surface. To align an actor perfectly with the ground use other means "
"like physics."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Meshes need to be triangulated to work as navigation meshes. Other mesh face "
"formats like quad or ngon are not supported."

msgid "NavigationMesh rebaking at runtime"
msgstr "Malhas de Navegação"

msgid ""
"To rebake a ``NavigationMesh`` at runtime, use the NavigationRegion3D."
"bake_navigation_mesh() function. Another option is to use the "
"NavigationMeshGenerator.bake() Singleton function with the NavigationMesh "
"resource directly. If the navigation mesh resource is already prepared, the "
"region can be updated with the NavigationServer3D API directly as well."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Baking a NavigationMesh at runtime is a costly operation. Complex navigation "
"mesh take some time to bake and if done on the main thread can freeze a "
"game. (Re)baking a large navigation mesh is preferably done in a separate "
"thread."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Property values on a NavigationMesh resource like ``cell_size`` need to "
"match the actual mesh data stored inside in order to merge different "
"navigation meshes without issues."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"NavigationRegion2D and Navigation3D both use meshes to mark traversable "
"areas, only the tools to create them are different."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For 2D NavigationPolygon resources are used to draw outline points in the "
"editor. From these outline points the NavigationServer2D creates a mesh to "
"upload navigation data to the NavigationServer."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For 3D NavigationMesh resources are used. Instead of providing draw tools "
"the 3D variant provides an extensive amount of parameters to bake a "
"navigation mesh directly from 3D source geometry."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Technically there is no hard distinction between 2D and 3D how to use the "
"given toolsets to create flat navigation meshes. The 2D drawing tool can be "
"used to create a flat 3D navmesh and the 3D baking tool can be used to parse "
"flat 3D geometry into 2D appropriated navigationmeshes."
