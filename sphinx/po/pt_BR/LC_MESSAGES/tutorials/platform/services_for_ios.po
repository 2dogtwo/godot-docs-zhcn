"When requesting an asynchronous operation, the method will look like this:"

#: ../../docs/tutorials/platform/services_for_ios.rst:20
msgid ""
"The parameter will usually be a Dictionary, with the information necessary "
"to make the request, and the call will have two phases. First, the method "
"will immediately return an Error value. If the Error is not 'OK', the call "
"operation is completed, with an error probably caused locally (no internet "
"connection, API incorrectly configured, etc). If the error value is 'OK', a "
"response event will be produced and added to the 'pending events' queue. "
"Example:"

msgid ""
"Remember that when a call returns OK, the API will *always* produce an event "
"through the pending_event interface, even if it's an error, or a network "
"timeout, etc. You should be able to, for example, safely block the interface "
"waiting for a reply from the server. If any of the APIs don't behave this "
"way it should be treated as a bug."
