"The :ref:`SurfaceTool <doc_surfacetool>` provides a useful interface for "
"constructing geometry. The interface is similar to the :ref:"
"`ImmediateGeometry <class_immediategeometry>` node. You set each per-vertex "
"attribute (e.g. normal, uv, color) and then when you add a vertex it "
"captures the attributes."

"The SurfaceTool also provides some useful helper functions like ``index()`` "
"and ``generate_normals()``."

"When finished generating your geometry with the :ref:`SurfaceTool "
"<class_surfacetool>` call ``commit()`` to finished generating the mesh. If "
"an :ref:`ArrayMesh <class_ArrayMesh>` is passed to ``commit()`` then it "
"appends a new surface to the end of the ArrayMesh. While if nothing is "
"passed in, ``commit()`` returns an ArrayMesh."

"You can optionally add an index array, either by calling ``add_index()`` and "
"adding vertices to the index array or by calling ``index()`` which shrinks "
"the vertex array to remove duplicate vertices."

"Similarly, if you have an index array, but you want each vertex to be unique "
"(e.g. because you want to use unique normals or colors per face instead of "
"per-vertex), you can call ``deindex()``."

"If you don't add custom normals yourself, you can add them using "
"``generate_normals()``. The same goes for tangents."

msgid ""
"By default, when generating normals, they will be calculated on a per-face "
"basis. If you want smooth vertex normals, when adding vertices, call "
"``add_smooth_group()``. ``add_smooth_group()`` needs to be called while "
"building the geometry, e.g. before the call to ``add_vertex()`` (if non-"
"indexed) or ``add_index()`` (if indexed)."
