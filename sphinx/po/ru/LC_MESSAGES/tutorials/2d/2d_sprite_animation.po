"In this tutorial, you'll learn two different ways to create 2D animated "
"characters. Typically, when you create or download an animated character, it "
"will come in one of two ways: as individual images or as a single sprite "
"sheet containing all the animation's frames. Depending on which type of "
"assets you have, you can choose one of the following solutions."
