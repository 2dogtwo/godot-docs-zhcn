"This tutorial series aims to illustrate intended Godot workflows, i.e. the "
"\"best practices\" of defining one's game API. Godot allows for a great "
"amount of flexibility in how one designs a project's code and scene "
"structure. Each method will have its own advantages and disadvantages, so "
"outlining the best practices should help users feel less confused as they "
"further explore Godot's depth."

"This series is also designed to help get users thinking about the best way "
"to reason about best practices. It would be impossible to give a "
"comprehensive overview of what one should do for any arbitrary design "
"decision. As such, each article breaks problems down into the fundamental "
"questions they pose, suggests the available solutions, analyzes the "
"advantages and disadvantages of each option, and then highlights the best "
"course of action depending on the circumstances."

"While the articles in this series are largely topic-directed, it is "
"recommended that users begin with the :ref:`doc_what_are_godot_classes` "
"article. It is from there that the \"best practices\" for the rest of the "
"engine become more clear, based on established OOP practices."
