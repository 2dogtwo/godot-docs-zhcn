"HTML5 export allows publishing games made in Godot Engine to the browser. "
"This requires support for the recent technologies `WebAssembly <https://"
"webassembly.org/>`__ and `WebGL 2.0 <https://www.khronos.org/webgl/>`__ in "
"the user's browser. **Firefox** and **Chromium** (Chrome, Opera) are the "
"most popular supported browsers, **Safari** and **Edge** do not work yet. On "
"**iOS**, all browsers must be based on WebKit (i.e. Safari), so they will "
