msgstr ""

"Second, it allows the extraction a subtree of the scene to make it a scene "
"of its own, which answers the second and third questions: even if a scene "
"tree gets too deep, it can be split into smaller subtrees. This also allows "
"a better solution for reusability, as you can include any subtree as a child "
