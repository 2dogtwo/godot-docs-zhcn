"Godot allows extending the engine in a modular way. New modules can be "

"Modules are located in the ``modules/`` subdirectory of the build system. By "
"default, many different modules exist, such as GDScript (which, yes, is not "
"part of the base engine), the Mono runtime, a regular expressions module, "
"and others. As many new modules as desired can be created and combined, and "
"the SCons build system will take care of it transparently."
