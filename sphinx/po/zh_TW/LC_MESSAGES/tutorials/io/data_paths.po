msgid "File paths in Godot projects"
msgstr "準備專案"

msgid ""
"This page explains how file paths work inside Godot projects. You will learn "
"how to access paths in your projects using the ``res://`` and ``user://`` "
"notations and where Godot stores user files on your hard-drive."
msgstr ""

msgid "Path separators"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To as many platforms as possible, Godot only accepts UNIX-style path "
"separators (``/``). These work on all platforms, including Windows."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Instead of writing paths like ``C:\\Projects``, in Godot, you should write "
"``C:/Projects``."

msgid "Accessing files in the project folder"
msgstr "新增檔案至專案"

msgid ""
"Godot considers that a project exists in any folder that contains a "
"``project.godot`` text file, even if the file is empty. The folder that "
"contains this file is your project's root folder."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can access any file relative to it by writing paths starting with "
"``res://``, which stands for resources. For example, you can access an image "
"file ``character.png`` located in the project's root folder in code with the "
"following path: ``res://some_texture.png``."

msgid "Accessing persistent user data"
msgstr "存取場景節點"

msgid ""
"To store persistent data files, like the player's save or settings, you want "
"to use ``user://`` instead of ``res://`` as your path's prefix. This is "
"because when the game is running, the project's file system will likely be "
"read-only."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The ``user://`` prefix points to a different directory on the user's device. "
"On mobile and consoles, this path is unique to the project. On desktop, the "
"engine stores user files in ``~/.local/share/godot/app_userdata/Name`` on "
"macOS and Linux, and ``%APPDATA%/Name`` on Windows. ``Name`` is based on the "
"application name defined in the Project Settings, but you can override it on "
"a per-platform basis using :ref:`feature tags <doc_feature_tags>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On HTML5 exports, ``user://`` will refer to a virtual filesystem stored on "
"the device via IndexedDB. (Interaction with the main filesystem can still be "
"performed through the :ref:`JavaScript <class_JavaScript>` singleton.)"
msgstr ""

msgid "Editor data paths"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The editor uses different paths for user data, user settings, and cache, "
"depending on the platform. By default, these paths are:"

"Godot complies with the `XDG Base Directory Specification <https://"

"If you use `Godot packaged as a Flatpak <https://flathub.org/apps/details/"

msgstr ""

msgid "Self-contained mode"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you create a file called ``._sc_`` or ``_sc_`` in the same directory as "
"the editor binary, Godot will enable *self-contained mode*. This mode makes "
"Godot write all user data to a directory named ``editor_data/`` in the same "
"directory as the editor binary. You can use it to create a portable "
"installation of the editor."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The `Steam release of Godot <https://store.steampowered.com/app/404790/>`__ "
