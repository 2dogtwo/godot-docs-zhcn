"If you want to run a dedicated server for your project on a machine that "

"若想以獨立伺服器的模式在沒有 GPU 或顯示伺服器的機器上執行專案，則必須要使用伺"

"Since Godot 4.0, this can be done by running a Godot binary on any platform "
"with the ``--headless`` command line argument, or running a project exported "

"It is possible to use either an editor or export template (debug or release) "

"**Export template:** Use this one for running dedicated servers. It does not "

"**Server (伺服器)：** 用於在專用伺服器上執行。不包含編輯器的功能，因此比較"

"**Editor:** This binary contains editor functionality and is intended to be "
"used for exporting projects. This binary *can* be used to run dedicated "
"servers, but it's not recommended as it's larger and less optimized."

"**Headless (無週邊)：** 包含編輯器功能的二進位檔，目的是用來匯出專案。該二進"

"Export a PCK file only, preferably for the platform that matches the "
"platform that will host the server. Place this PCK file in the same folder "
"as an export template binary, rename the binary to have the same name as the "
"PCK (minus the file extension), then run the binary."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"Both methods should result in identical output. The rest of the page will "
"focus on the first approach."
msgstr "這兩種方法產生的結果都相同。下方說明了 PCK 檔的這個方法。"

msgid "Exporting a project for a dedicated server"
msgstr "為專用伺服器匯出"

msgid ""
"If you export a project as usual when targeting a server, you will notice "
"that the PCK file is just as large as for the client. This is because it "
"includes all resources, including those the server doesn't need (such as "
"texture data). Additionally, headless mode won't be automatically used; the "
"user will have to specify ``--headless`` to make sure no window spawns."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Many resources such as textures can be stripped from the PCK file to greatly "
"reduce its size. Godot offers a way to do this for textures and materials in "
"a way that preserves references in scene or resource files (built-in or "
"external)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To begin doing so, make sure you have a dedicated export preset for your "
"server, then select it, go to its **Resources** tab and change its export "
"mode:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Choosing the **Export as dedicated server** export mode in the export preset"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When this export mode is chosen, the ``dedicated_server`` feature tag is "
"automatically added to the exported project."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you do not wish to use this export mode but still want the feature tag, "
"you can write the name ``dedicated_server`` in the **Features** tab of the "
"export preset. This will also force ``--headless`` when running the exported "
"project."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"After selecting this export mode, you will be presented with a list of "
"resources in the project:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Choosing resources to keep, keep with stripped visuals or remove"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Ticking a box allows you to override options for the specified file or "
"folder. Checking boxes does **not** affect which files are exported; this is "
"done by the options selected for each checkbox instead."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Files within a checked folder will automatically use the parent's option by "
"default, which is indicated by the **(Inherited)** suffix for the option "
"name (and the option name being grayed out). To change the option for a file "
"whose option is currently inherited, you must tick the box next to it first."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Strip Visuals:** Export this resource, with visual files (textures and "
"materials) replaced by placeholder classes. Placeholder classes store the "
"image size (as it's sometimes used to position elements in a 2D scene), but "
"nothing else."
msgstr ""

msgid "**Keep:** Export this resource as usual, with visual files interact."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Remove:** The file is not included in the PCK. This is useful to ignore "
"scenes and resources that only the client needs. If you do so, make sure the "
"server doesn't reference these client-only scenes and resources in any way."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The general recommendation is to use **Strip Visuals** whenever possible, "
"unless the server needs to access image data such as pixels' colors. For "
"example, if your server generates collision data based on an image's "
"contents, you need to use **Keep** for that particular image."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To check the file structure of your exported PCK, use the **Export PCK/ZIP..."
"** button with a ``.zip`` file extension, then open the resulting ZIP file "
"in a file manager."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Be careful when using the **Remove** mode, as scenes/resources that "
"reference a removed file will no longer be able to load successfully."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you wish to remove specific resources but make the scenes still be able "
"to load without them, you'll have to remove the reference in the scene file "
"and load the files to the nodes' properties using ``load()`` in a script. "
"This approach can be used to strip resources that Godot doesn't support "
"replacing with placeholders yet, such as audio."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Removing textures is often what makes the greatest impact on the PCK size, "
"so it is recommended to stick with **Strip Visuals** at first."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"With the above options used, a PCK for the client (which exports all "
"resources normally) will look as follows:"

"On Linux, to make your dedicated server restart after a crash or system "

"在 Linux 中，請確保專用伺服器會在當機或系統重開機的時候重新啟動，可以 `建立 "

"systemd 會提供自動日誌切割 (log rotatioin)。"

"If you have experience with containers, you could also look into wrapping "
"your dedicated server in a `Docker <https://www.docker.com/>`__ container. "
"This way, it can be used more easily in an automatic scaling setup (which is "
"outside the scope of this tutorial)."
msgstr ""
"若有 Container 的使用經驗，也可以試試將專屬伺服器包裝在 `Docker <https://www."
