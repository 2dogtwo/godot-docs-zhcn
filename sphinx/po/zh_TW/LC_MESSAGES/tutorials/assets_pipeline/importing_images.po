"**Lossless:** This is the default and most common compression mode for 2D "

msgid ""
"To support :ref:`multiple resolutions <doc_multiple_resolutions>` with crisp "

msgstr "Godot 沒有使用限制"

msgid ""
"Use a high base resolution in the project settings (such as 4K), then use "
"the textures at original scale. This is an easier approach."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Use a low base resolution in the project settings (such as 1080p), then "
"downscale textures when using them. This is often more difficult and can "
"make various calculations in script tedious, so the approach described above "
"is recommended instead."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"After doing this, you may notice that textures become grainy at lower "
"viewport resolutions. To resolve this, enable **Mipmaps** on textures used "
"in 2D in the Import dock. This will increase memory usage."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Enabling mipmaps can also make textures appear blurrier, but you can choose "
"to make textures sharper (at the cost of some graininess) by setting "
"**Rendering > Textures > Default Filters > Texture Mipmap Bias** to a "
"negative value."

msgid "Use appropriate texture sizes in 3D"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"While there's no \"one size fits all\" recommendation, here are some general "
"recommendations for choosing texture sizes in 3D:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The size of a texture should be adjusted to have a consistent texel density "
"compared to surrounding objects. While this cannot be ensured perfectly when "
"sticking to power-of-two texture sizes, it's usually possible to keep "
"texture detail fairly consistent throughout a 3D scene."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The smaller the object appears on screen, the smaller its texture should be. "
"For example, a tree that only appears in the background doesn't need a "
"texture resolution as high as other objects the player may be able to walk "
"close to."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Using power-of-two texture sizes is recommended, but is not required. "
"Textures don't have to be square – sizes such as 1024×512 are acceptable."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There are diminishing returns to using large texture sizes, despite the "
"increased memory usage and loading times. Most modern 3D games not using a "
"pixel art style stick to 2048×2048 textures on average, with 1024×1024 and "
"512×512 for textures spanning smaller surfaces."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When working with physically-based materials in 3D, you can reduce memory "
"usage and file size without affecting quality too much by using a lower "
"resolution for certain texture maps. This works especially well for textures "
"that only feature low-frequency detail (such as a normal map for a snow "
"texture)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you have control over how the 3D models are created, these tips are also "
"worth exploring:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When working with 3D models that are mostly symmetrical, you may be able to "
"use mirrored UVs to double the effective texel density. This may look "
"unnatural when used on human faces though."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When working with 3D models using a low-poly style and plain colors, you can "
"rely on vertex colors instead of textures to represent colors on the model's "
"surfaces."
