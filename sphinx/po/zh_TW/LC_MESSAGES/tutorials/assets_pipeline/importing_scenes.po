msgid ""
"Godot uses a right-handed, Y-is-up coordinate system, with the -Z axis as "

msgid ""
"The convention for 3D assets is to face the opposite direction as the "

"registry.khronos.org/glTF/specs/2.0/glTF-2.0.html#coordinate-system-and-"
"units>`__. This means that for oriented 3D assets (such as characters), the "
"+Z axis is the direction of the front, so -Z is the rear, +X is the left "
"side, and -X is the right side for a 3D asset. In Blender, this means that "
"+Y is rear and -Y is front for an asset."

msgid ""
"For assets without an intrinsic front side or forward direction, such as a "
"game map or terrain, take note of the cardinal directions instead. The "
"convention in Godot and the vast majority of other applications is that +X "
"is east and -X is west. Due to Godot's right-handed Y-is-up coordinate "
"system, this implies that +Z is south and -Z is north. In Blender, this "

msgid ""
"There are two reasons to use glTF with the textures separate. One is to have "
"the scene description in a text based format and the binary data in a "
"separate binary file. This can be useful for version control if you want to "
"review changes in a text-based format. The second is you need the texture "
"files separate from the material file. If you don't need either of those, "
"glTF binary files are fine."
msgstr ""

msgid "Exporting considerations"
msgstr "其他建議"

msgid ""
"Since GPUs can only render triangles, meshes that contain quads or N-gons "
"have to be *triangulated* before they can be rendered. Godot can triangulate "
"meshes on import, but results may be unpredictable or incorrect, especially "
"with N-gons. Regardless of the target application, triangulating *before* "
"exporting the scene will lead to more consistent results and should be done "
"whenever possible."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To avoid issues with incorrect triangulation after importing in Godot, it is "
"recommended to make the 3D modeling software triangulate objects on its own. "
"In Blender, this can be done by adding a Triangulate modifier to your "
"objects and making sure **Apply Modifiers** is checked in the export dialog. "
"Alternatively, depending on the exporter, you may be able to find and enable "
"a **Triangulate Faces** option in the export dialog."

"To avoid issues with 3D selection in the editor, it is recommended to apply "
"the object transform in the 3D modeling software before exporting the scene."
