"In Godot, class members can be exported. This means their value gets saved "
"along with the resource (such as the :ref:`scene <class_PackedScene>`) "
"they're attached to. They will also be available for editing in the property "
"editor. Exporting is done by using the ``@export`` annotation."

"An exported variable must be initialized to a constant expression or have a "

"One of the fundamental benefits of exporting member variables is to have "
"them visible and editable in the editor. This way, artists and game "
"designers can modify values that later influence how the program runs. For "
"this, a special export syntax is provided."

"匯出成員變數的其中一個基本的好處就是能在編輯器中瀏覽並編輯。這樣一來，如美術"
