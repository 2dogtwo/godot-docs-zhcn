"`Rider <https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/>`_ is a commercial `JetBrains "

"If you already use Visual Studio as your main IDE, you can use the same "
"solution file in Rider. Rider and Visual Studio use the same solution "
"format, so you can switch between the two IDEs without rebuilding the "
"solution file. Debug configurations need to be changed when going from one "
"IDE to another."

"Rider requires a solution file to work on a project. While Godot does not "
"come with the solution file, it can be generated using SCons."

"使用 Visual Studio 會需要一個解決方案檔案。雖然 Godot 沒有附帶解決方案檔，但"

"If you have Rider setup as your main IDE for .sln, you can now open the "

"接著可以按兩下專案根目錄中的 ``godot.sln`` 來開啟專案，或是可以通過 Visual "
"Studio 中的 **開啟專案或解決方案** 來開啟。"

"Rider could fail to build the first time you open the project. If that is "
"the case, you can close Rider and open the solution in Visual Studio, build "
"it, close Visual Studio, and open the solution in Rider again. You are now "

"Rider comes with a built-in debugger that can be used to debug the Godot "
