"In Godot it is possible to export 3D scenes as a glTF 2.0 file. You can "
"export as a glTF binary (``.glb`` file) or glTF embedded with textures "
"(``gltf`` + ``.bin`` + textures). This allows you to create scenes in Godot, "
"such as a CSG mesh blockout for a level, export it to clean it up in a "
"program such as Blender, and then bring it back into Godot."
