"The simplest way to distribute a game for PC is to copy the executables "
"(``godot.exe`` on Windows, ``godot`` on the rest), compress the folder and "
"send it to someone else. However, this is often not desired."

"要為 PC 發佈遊戲最簡單的方法就是複製可執行檔 (Windows 上為 ``godot.exe`` ，其"
"餘為 ``godot``)，壓縮資料夾並將壓縮檔傳送給其他人。但我們通常不想這麼做。"

"Godot offers a more elegant approach for PC distribution when using the "
"export system. When exporting for PC (Linux, Windows, macOS), the exporter "
"takes all the project files and creates a ``data.pck`` file. This file is "
"bundled with a specially optimized binary that is smaller, faster and does "
"not contain the editor and debugger."
msgstr ""
"通過匯出系統，Godot 提供一種更優雅的方法來在 PC 平台上發佈。為 PC 平台匯出時 "
"(Linux, Windows, macOS)，匯出工具會以所有的專案檔案建立成一個 ``data.pck`` 檔"
"案。該檔案會內涵一個特別最佳化過的二進位，這個二進位檔更小、更快，而且不包含"
"編輯器與除錯工具。"
