msgid ""
"**GDExtension** is a Godot-specific technology that lets the engine interact "
"with native `shared libraries <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"
"Library_(computing)#Shared_libraries>`__ at run-time. You can use it to run "
"native code without compiling it with the engine."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"GDExtension is *not* a scripting language and has no relation to :ref:"
"`GDScript <doc_gdscript>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Differences between GDExtension and C++ modules"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can use both GDExtension and :ref:`C++ modules "
"<doc_custom_modules_in_cpp>` to run C or C++ code in a Godot project."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"They also both allow you to integrate third-party libraries into Godot. The "
"one you should choose depends on your needs."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you notice that specific systems are not accessible via GDExtension but "
"are via custom modules feel free to open an issue on the `godot-cpp "
"repository <https://github.com/godotengine/godot-cpp>`__ to discuss "
"implementation options to expose the missing functionality."
msgstr ""

msgid "Advantages of GDExtension"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Unlike modules, GDExtension doesn't require compiling the engine's source "
"code, making it easier to distribute your work. It gives you access to most "
"of the API available to GDScript and C#, allowing you to code game logic "
"with full control regarding performance. It's ideal if you need high-"
"performance code you'd like to distribute as an add-on in the :ref:`asset "
"library <doc_what_is_assetlib>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Also:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"GDExtension is not limited to C and C++. Thanks to :ref:`third-party "
"bindings <doc_what_is_gdnative_third_party_bindings>`, you can use it with "
"many other languages."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can use the same compiled GDExtension library in the editor and exported "
"project. With C++ modules, you have to recompile all the export templates "
"you plan to use if you require its functionality at run-time."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"GDExtension only requires you to compile your library, not the whole engine. "
"That's unlike C++ modules, which are statically compiled into the engine. "
"Every time you change a module, you need to recompile the engine. Even with "
"incremental builds, this process is slower than using GDExtension."
msgstr ""

msgid "Advantages of C++ modules"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We recommend :ref:`C++ modules <doc_custom_modules_in_cpp>` in cases where "
"GDExtension isn't enough:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"C++ modules provide deeper integration into the engine. GDExtension's access "
"is not as deep as static modules"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can use C++ modules to provide additional features in a project without "
"carrying native library files around. This extends to exported projects."

"Not all bindings mentioned here may be production-ready. Make sure to "
"research options thoroughly before starting a project with one of those. "
"Also, double-check whether the binding is compatible with the Godot version "
"you're using."
msgstr ""

msgid "Version compatibility"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"GDExtension add-ons compiled for a given Godot version are only guaranteed "
"to work with the same minor release series. For example, a GDExtension add-"
"on compiled for Godot 4.0 will only work with Godot 4.0, 4.0.1, 4.0.2. In "
"addition, GDExtension is not compatible with Godot 3.x."
