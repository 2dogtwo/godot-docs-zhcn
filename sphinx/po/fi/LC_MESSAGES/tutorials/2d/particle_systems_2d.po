"The idea is that a \"particle\" is emitted at a fixed interval and with a "

"behavior. What makes each particle different from the rest and provides a "
"more organic look is the \"randomness\" associated with each parameter. In "
"essence, creating a particle system means setting base physics parameters "
"and then adding randomness to them."
