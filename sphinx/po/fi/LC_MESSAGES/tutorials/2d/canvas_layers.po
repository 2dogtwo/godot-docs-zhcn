"Regular 2D nodes, such as :ref:`Node2D <class_Node2D>` or :ref:`Control "
"<class_Control>` both inherit from :ref:`CanvasItem <class_CanvasItem>`, "
"which is the base for all 2D nodes. CanvasItems can be arranged in trees. "
"Each item will inherit its parent's transform. This means that when the "
"parent is moved, the children will move too."

"Tavalliset 2D-solmut, kuten :ref:`Node2D <class_Node2D>` ja :ref:`Control "
"<class_Control>`, periytyvät :ref:`CanvasItem <class_CanvasItem>` solmusta, "
"joka on kaikkien 2D-solmujen perusta. CanvasItemit voidaan järjestää "
"puurakenteisiin. Kukin solmu perii muunnoksensa ylemmältä tasolta. Tämä "
"tarkoittaa, että siirtämällä yhtä solmua myös kaikki sen alisolmut siirtyvät "
"mukana."

"A Viewport has the property :ref:`Viewport.canvas_transform "

"Viewport-solmulla on ominaisuus :ref:`Viewport.canvas_transform "

"The answer is :ref:`CanvasLayer <class_CanvasLayer>`, which is a node that "
"adds a separate 2D rendering layer for all its children and grand-children. "
"Viewport children will draw by default at layer \"0\", while a CanvasLayer "
"will draw at any numeric layer. Layers with a greater number will be drawn "
"above those with a smaller number. CanvasLayers also have their own "
"transform and do not depend on the transform of other layers. This allows "
"the UI to be fixed in screen-space while our view on the game world changes."

"CanvasLayers aren't necessary to control the drawing order of nodes. The "
"standard way to ensuring that a node is  correctly drawn 'in front' or "
"'behind' others is to manipulate the order of the nodes in the scene panel. "
"Perhaps counterintuitively, the topmost nodes in the scene panel are drawn "
"on *behind* lower ones in the viewport. 2d nodes also have a property for "
"controlling their drawing order (see :ref:`Node2D.z_index "
"<class_Node2D_property_z_index>`)."
