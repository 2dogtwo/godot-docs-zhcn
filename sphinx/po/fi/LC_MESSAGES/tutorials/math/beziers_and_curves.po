"Just evaluating them may be an option, but in most cases it's not very "

"constant speed, from ``t = 0`` to ``t = 1``, the actual interpolation will "
"*not* move at constant speed. The speed is also an interpolation between the "

"Drawing beziers (or objects based on the curve) is a very common use case, "

"without creating a very high amount of them."

"require considerable amounts of points, while other sections may not:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/math/beziers_and_curves.rst:181

"Additionally, if both control points were ``0, 0`` (remember they are "

"Before drawing Bezier curves, *tessellation* is required. This is often done "

"the curvature amount becomes less than a certain threshold."

msgid ""
"The *Curve* classes provide this via the :ref:`Curve2D.tessellate() "
"<class_Curve2D_method_tessellate>` function (which receives optional "
"``stages`` of recursion and angle ``tolerance`` arguments). This way, "
"drawing something based on a curve is easier."

"To make this easier, the curves need to be *baked* into equidistant points. "
"This way, they can be approximated with regular  interpolation (which can be "
"improved further with a cubic option). To do this, just use the :ref:`Curve."
"interpolate_baked()<class_Curve_method_interpolate_baked>` method together "
"with :ref:`Curve2D."
"get_baked_length()<class_Curve2D_method_get_baked_length>`. The first call "
