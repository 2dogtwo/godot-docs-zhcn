msgid "Optimizing a build for size"
msgstr ""

msgid "Rationale"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Sometimes, it is desired to optimize a build for size rather than speed. "
"This means not compiling unused functions from the engine, as well as using "
"specific compiler flags to aid on decreasing build size. Common situations "
"include creating builds for mobile and Web platforms."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This tutorial aims to give an overview on different methods to create a "
"smaller binary. Before continuing, it is recommended to read the previous "
"tutorials on compiling Godot for each platform."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can use the online `Godot build options generator <https://godot-build-"
"options-generator.github.io/>`__ to generate a ``custom.py`` file containing "
"SCons options. You can then save this file and place it at the root of your "
"Godot source directory."

msgid "Disabling 3D"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For 2D games, having the whole 3D engine available usually makes no sense. "
"Because of this, there is a build flag to disable it:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Tools must be disabled in order to use this flag, as the editor is not "
"designed to operate without 3D support. Without it, the binary size can be "
"reduced by about 15%."
msgstr ""

msgid "Disabling advanced GUI nodes"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Most small games don't require complex GUI controls such as Tree, ItemList, "
"TextEdit or GraphEdit. They can be disabled using a build flag:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Disabling unwanted modules"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A lot of Godot's functions are offered as modules. You can see a list of "
"modules with the following command:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The list of modules that can be disabled will appear, together with all "
"build options. If you are working on a simple 2D game, you could disable a "
"lot of them:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If this proves not to work for your use case, you should review the list of "
"modules and see which ones you actually still need for your game (e.g. you "
"might want to keep networking-related modules, regex support, or theora/webm "
"to play videos)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Alternatively, you can supply a list of disabled modules by creating "
"``custom.py`` at the root of the source, with the contents similar to the "
"following:"
msgstr ""

msgid ":ref:`doc_overriding_build_options`."
msgstr ":ref:`doc_overriding_build_options`."

msgid "Optimizing for size instead of speed"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot 3.1 onwards allows compiling using size optimizations (instead of "
"speed). To enable this, set the ``optimize`` flag to ``size``:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Some platforms such as WebAssembly already use this mode by default."
msgstr ""

msgid "Compiling with link-time optimization"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Enabling link-time optimization produces more efficient binaries, both in "
"terms of performance and file size. It works by eliminating duplicate "
"template functions and unused code. It can currently be used with the GCC "
"and MSVC compilers:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Linking becomes much slower and more RAM consuming with this option, so it "
"should be used only for release builds."
msgstr ""

msgid "Stripping binaries"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you build from source, remember to strip debug symbols from binaries:"
msgstr ""
