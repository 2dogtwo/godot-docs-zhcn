"A lot of modifiers are not compatible with shape keys (e.g. subsurface "
"modifier), so if you found you have incorrect shape keys exported, try to "
"disable :code:`Apply Modifiers` and do the exporting again. Besides, it is "
"worthwhile to report the incompatible modifier to the `issue list <https://"
"github.com/godotengine/godot-blender-exporter/issues>`__, which helps to "
"develop the exporter to have a more precise check of modifiers."
