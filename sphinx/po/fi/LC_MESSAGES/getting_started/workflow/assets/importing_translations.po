"The world is full of different markets and cultures and, to maximize "
"profits™, nowadays games are released in several languages. To solve this, "
"internationalized text must be supported in any modern game engine."

msgid ""
"In regular desktop or mobile applications, internationalized text is usually "
"located in resource files (or .po files for GNU stuff). Games, however, can "
"use several orders of magnitude more text than applications, so they must "
"support efficient methods for dealing with loads of multilingual text."

msgid ""
"There are two approaches to generate multilingual language games and "
"applications. Both are based on a key:value system. The first is to use one "
"of the languages as the key (usually English), the second is to use a "
"specific identifier. The first approach is probably easier for development "
"if a game is released first in English, later in other languages, but a "
"complete nightmare if working with many languages at the same time."

"In general, games use the second approach and a unique ID is used for each "
"string. This allows you to revise the text while it is being translated to "
"other languages. The unique ID can be a number, a string, or a string with a "
"number (it's just a unique string anyway)."

"To complete the picture and allow efficient support for translations, Godot "
"has a special importer that can read CSV files. Most spreadsheet editors can "
"export to this format, so the only requirement is that the files have a "
