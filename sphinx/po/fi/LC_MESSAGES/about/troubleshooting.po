"käyttäessä."

msgid ""
"See :ref:`doc_using_the_web_editor` for caveats specific to the HTML5 "
"version of the Godot editor."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Everything I do in the editor or project manager appears delayed by one "
"frame."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is a `known bug <https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/23069>`__ "
"on Intel graphics drivers on Windows. Updating to the latest graphics driver "
"version *provided by Intel* should fix the issue."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You should use the graphics driver provided by Intel rather than the one "
"provided by your desktop or laptop's manufacturer because their version is "
"often outdated."
msgstr ""
"Sinun tulisi käyttää Intelin tarjoamia näytönohjainajureita työpöytäsi tai "
"kannettavan tietokoneesi valmistajan tarjoamien ajureiden sijaan, koska ne "
"ovat usein tuoreammat."

msgid ""
"The grid disappears and meshes turn black when I rotate the 3D camera in the "
"editor."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is a `known bug <https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/30330>`__ "
"on Intel graphics drivers on Windows."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The only workaround, for now, is to switch to the GLES2 renderer. You can "
"switch the renderer in the top-right corner of the editor or the Project "
"Settings."
msgstr ""
"Tällä hetkellä ainoa kiertotie on vaihtaa GLES2 renderöijään. Voit vaihtaa "
"renderöijää editorin yläoikeasta kulmasta tai projektin asetuksista."

msgid ""
"If you use a computer allowing you to switch your graphics card, like NVIDIA "
"Optimus, you can use the dedicated graphics card to run Godot."
msgstr ""

msgid "The editor or project takes a very long time to start."
msgstr "Editorin tai projektin käynnistyminen kestää pitkään."

msgid ""
"This is a `known bug <https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/20566>`__ "
"on Windows when you have specific USB peripherals connected. In particular, "
"Corsair's iCUE software seems to cause the bug. Try updating your USB "
"peripherals' drivers to their latest version. If the bug persists, you need "
"to disconnect the faulty peripherals before opening the editor. You can then "
"connect the peripheral again."

"Editor tooltips in the Inspector and Node docks blink when they're displayed."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is a `known issue <https://github.com/godotengine/godot/"
"issues/32990>`__ caused by the third-party Stardock Fences application on "
"Windows. The only known workaround is to disable Stardock Fences while using "
"Godot."
msgstr ""

msgid "The Godot editor appears frozen after clicking the system console."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"When running Godot on Windows with the system console enabled, you can "
"accidentally enable *selection mode* by clicking inside the command window. "
"This Windows-specific behavior pauses the application to let you select text "
"inside the system console. Godot cannot override this system-specific "
"behavior."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To solve this, select the system console window and press Enter to leave "
"selection mode."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some text such as \"NO DC\" appears in the top-left corner of the project "
"manager and editor window."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is caused by the NVIDIA graphics driver injecting an overlay to display "
"information."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To disable this overlay on Windows, restore your graphics driver settings to "
"the default values in the NVIDIA Control Panel."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To disable this overlay on Linux, open ``nvidia-settings``, go to **X Screen "
"0 > OpenGL Settings** then uncheck **Enable Graphics API Visual Indicator**."
msgstr ""

msgid "The project window appears blurry, unlike the editor."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Unlike the editor, the project isn't marked as DPI-aware by default. This is "
"done to improve performance, especially on integrated graphics, where "
"rendering 3D scenes in hiDPI is slow."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"To resolve this, open **Project > Project Settings** and enable **Display > "
"Window > Dpi > Allow Hidpi**. On top of that, make sure your project is "
"configured to support :ref:`multiple resolutions <doc_multiple_resolutions>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "The project window doesn't appear centered when I run the project."
msgstr "Projektin ikkuna ei näy keskitettynä kun käynnistän projektin."

msgid ""
"This is a `known bug <https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/13017>`__. "
"To resolve this, open **Project > Project Settings** and enable **Display > "
"Window > Dpi > Allow Hidpi**. On top of that, make sure your project is "
"configured to support :ref:`multiple resolutions <doc_multiple_resolutions>`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The project works when run from the editor, but fails to load some files "
"when running from an exported copy."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is usually caused by forgetting to specify a filter for non-resource "
"files in the Export dialog. By default, Godot will only include actual "
"*resources* into the PCK file. Some files commonly used, such as JSON files, "
"are not considered resources. For example, if you load ``test.json`` in the "
"exported project, you need to specify ``*.json`` in the non-resource export "
"filter. See :ref:`doc_exporting_projects_export_mode` for more information."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"On Windows, this can also be due to :ref:`case sensitivity "
"<doc_project_organization_case_sensitivity>` issues. If you reference a "
"resource in your script with a different case than on the filesystem, "
"loading will fail once you export the project. This is because the virtual "
"PCK filesystem is case-sensitive, while Windows's filesystem is case-"
"insensitive by default."
