"Godot uses ``major.minor.patch`` version numbering. However, it does not "
"strictly follow `Semantic Versioning <https://semver.org/>`__. This means "
"that releases considered \"semver-minor\" by that standard (such as 3.1 -> "
"3.2) will most likely introduce breaking changes. Still, there won't be as "
"many breaking changes as a \"semver-major\" version bump such as 3.2 -> 4.0."

"In the interest of stability and usability, patch releases may occasionally "
