"WebAssembly can be compiled in two ways: The default is to first compile to "

"*fastcomp* fork of LLVM. This code is then translated to WebAssembly using a "
"tool called ``asm2wasm``. Emscripten automatically takes care of both "

"The other method uses LLVM's WebAssembly backend. This backend is not yet "
"available in release versions of LLVM, only in development builds built with "
"``LLVM_EXPERIMENTAL_TARGETS_TO_BUILD=WebAssembly``. Compiling with this "
"backend outputs files in LLVM's ``.s`` format, which is translated into "
"actual WebAssembly using a tool called ``s2wasm``. Emscripten manages these "

"In order to choose one of the two methods, the ``LLVM_ROOT`` variable in the "

"is used. This is the default in a normal Emscripten installation. Otherwise, "
"LLVM binaries built with the WebAssembly backend will be expected and "
"``s2wasm`` is used. On Windows, make sure to escape backslashes of paths "
"within this file as double backslashes ``\\\\`` or use Unix-style paths with "
