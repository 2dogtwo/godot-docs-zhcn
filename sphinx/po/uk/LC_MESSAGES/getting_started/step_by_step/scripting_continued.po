"However, it is still common to need a script to be processed on every frame. "
"There are two types of processing: idle processing and physics processing."

msgid ""
"Idle processing is activated when the method :ref:`Node._process() "

"It's important to bear in mind that the frequency with which ``_process()`` "
"will be called depends on how many frames per second (FPS) your application "
"is running at. This rate can vary over time and devices."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/step_by_step/scripting_continued.rst:40
msgid ""
"To help manage this variability the ``delta`` parameter contains the time "

"``_process()``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/step_by_step/scripting_continued.rst:43

"For example, movement is often multiplied with a time delta to make movement "

msgid ""
"Physics processing with ``_physics_process()`` is similar, but it should be "
"used for processes that must happen before each physics step, such as "
"controlling a character. It always runs before a physics step and it is "
"called at fixed time intervals: 60 times per second by default. You can "
"change the interval from the Project Settings, under Physics -> Common -> "
"Physics Fps."

"The function ``_process()``, however, is not synced with physics. Its frame "

"execution is done after the physics step on single-threaded games."

"A simple way to see the ``_process()`` function at work is to create a scene "

"Groups in Godot work like tags you might have come across in other software. "
"A node can be added to as many groups as desired. This is a useful feature "
"for organizing large scenes. There are two ways to add nodes to groups. The "
"first is from the UI, using the Groups button under the Node panel:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/step_by_step/scripting_continued.rst:97

"And the second way is from code. The following script would add the current "

"The :ref:`SceneTree <class_SceneTree>` class provides many useful methods, "

"Godot has a system of notifications. These are usually not needed for "

"To delete a node, be it inside or outside the scene, ``free()`` must be used:"

"When a node is freed, it also frees all its child nodes. Because of this, "

"A situation might occur where we want to delete a node that is currently "
