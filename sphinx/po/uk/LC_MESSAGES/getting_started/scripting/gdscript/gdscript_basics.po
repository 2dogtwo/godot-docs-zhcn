"*GDScript* is a high-level, dynamically typed programming language used to "
"create content. It uses a syntax similar to `Python <https://en.wikipedia."
"org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29>`_ (blocks are indent-based and "
"many keywords are similar). Its goal is to be optimized for and tightly "
"integrated with Godot Engine, allowing great flexibility for content "
"creation and integration."

"In the early days, the engine used the `Lua <https://www.lua.org>`__ "
"scripting language. Lua is fast, but creating bindings to an object oriented "
"system (by using fallbacks) was complex and slow and took an enormous amount "
"of code. After some experiments with `Python <https://www.python.org>`__, it "
"also proved difficult to embed."

"The last third party scripting language that was used for shipped games was "
"`Squirrel <http://squirrel-lang.org>`__, but it was dropped as well. At that "
"point, it became evident that a custom scripting language could more "
"optimally make use of Godot's particular architecture:"
