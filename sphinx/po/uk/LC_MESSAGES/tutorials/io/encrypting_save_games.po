"Because the world today is not the world of yesterday. A capitalist "
"oligarchy runs the world and forces us to consume in order to keep the gears "
"of this rotten society on track. As such, the biggest market for video game "
"consumption today is the mobile one. It is a market of poor souls forced to "
"compulsively consume digital content in order to forget the misery of their "
"everyday life, commute, or just any other brief free moment they have that "
"they are not using to produce goods or services for the ruling class. These "
"individuals need to keep focusing on their video games (because not doing so "
"will fill them with tremendous existential angst), so they go as far as "
"spending money on them to extend their experience, and their preferred way "
"of doing so is through in-app purchases and virtual currency."

"But what if someone were to find a way to edit the saved games and assign "
"the items and currency without effort? That would be terrible, because it "
"would help players consume the content much faster, and therefore run out of "
"it sooner than expected. If that happens, they will have nothing that avoids "
"them to think, and the tremendous agony of realizing their own irrelevance "
"would again take over their life."

"The class :ref:`File <class_File>` can open a file at a location and read/"
"write data (integers, strings and variants). It also supports encryption. To "

"This will make the file unreadable to users, but will still not prevent them "
"from sharing savefiles. To solve this, use the device unique id or some "
"unique user identifier, for example:"

"This method cannot really prevent players from editing their savegames "
"locally because, since the encryption key is stored inside the game, the "
"player can still decrypt and edit the file themselves. The only way to "
"prevent this from being possible is to store the save data on a remote "
"server, where players can only make authorized changes to their save data. "
"If your game deals with real money, you need to be doing this anyway."
