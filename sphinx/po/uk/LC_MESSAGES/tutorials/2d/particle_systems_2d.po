"The idea is that a \"particle\" is emitted at a fixed interval and with a "
"fixed lifetime. During its lifetime, every particle will have the same base "
"behavior. What makes every particle different and provides a more organic "
"look is the \"randomness\" associated to each parameter. In essence, "
"creating a particle system means setting base physics parameters and then "
"adding randomness to them."
