"anything that inherits :ref:`Resource <class_Resource>` can be directly "
"casted to an RID (not all resources contain an RID, though, in such cases "
"the RID will be empty). In fact, resources can be passed to server APIs as "
"RIDs. Just make sure to keep references to the resources outside the server, "
