"Walking around a town for example, you may only be able to see a few "
"buildings in the street you are in, as well as the sky and a few birds "
"flying overhead. As far as a naive renderer is concerned however, you can "
"still see the entire town. It won't just render the buildings in front of "
"you, it will render the street behind that, with the people on that street, "
"the buildings behind that. You quickly end up in situations where you are "
"attempting to render 10× or 100× more than what is visible."

"Things aren't quite as bad as they seem, because the Z-buffer usually allows "
"the GPU to only fully shade the objects that are at the front. This is "
"called *depth prepass* and is enabled by default in Godot when using the "
"GLES3 renderer. However, unneeded objects are still reducing performance."

"One way we can potentially reduce the amount to be rendered is to take "
"advantage of occlusion. As of Godot 3.3, there is no built in support for "
"occlusion in Godot. However, with careful design you can still get many of "
"the advantages."

"For instance, in our city street scenario, you may be able to work out in "
"advance that you can only see two other streets, ``B`` and ``C``, from "
"street ``A``. Streets ``D`` to ``Z`` are hidden. In order to take advantage "
"of occlusion, all you have to do is work out when your viewer is in street "
"``A`` (perhaps using Godot Areas), then you can hide the other streets."

"This is a manual version of what is known as a \"potentially visible set\". "
"It is a very powerful technique for speeding up rendering. You can also use "

"as rendering."

"In some cases, you may have to adapt your level design to add more occlusion "

"player from seeing too far away, which would decrease performance due to the "

"Godot sorts objects by :ref:`Material <class_Material>` and :ref:`Shader "
"<class_Shader>` to improve performance. This, however, can not be done with "
"transparent objects. Transparent objects are rendered from back to front to "
"make blending with what is behind work. As a result, **try to use as few "
"transparent objects as possible**. If an object has a small section with "
"transparency, try to make that section a separate surface with its own "
"material."

"In some situations, particularly at a distance, it can be a good idea to "
"**replace complex geometry with simpler versions**. The end user will "
"probably not be able to see much difference. Consider looking at a large "
"number of trees in the far distance. There are several strategies for "
"replacing models at varying distance. You could use lower poly models, or "
"use transparency to simulate more complex geometry."

"The simplest version of using transparency to deal with LOD is billboards. "
"For example, you can use a single transparent quad to represent a tree at "
"distance. This can be very cheap to render, unless of course, there are many "
"trees in front of each other. In which case transparency may start eating "
"into fill rate (for more information on fill rate, see :ref:"

"An alternative is to render not just one tree, but a number of trees "

"You can make imposters by pre-rendering views of an object at different "
"angles. Or you can even go one step further, and periodically re-render a "
"view of an object onto a texture to be used as an imposter. At a distance, "
"you need to move the viewer a considerable distance for the angle of view to "
"change significantly. This can be complex to get working, but may be worth "
"it depending on the type of project you are making."
