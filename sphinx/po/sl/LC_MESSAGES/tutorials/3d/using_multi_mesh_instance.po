"In a normal scenario you would use a :ref:`MeshInstance "
"<class_MeshInstance>` node to display a 3D mesh like a human model for the "
"main character. But in some cases you would like to create multiple "
"instances of the same mesh in a scene. You *could* duplicate the same node "
"multiple times and adjust the transforms manually. This may be a tedious "
"process and the result may look mechanical. Also, this method is not "
"favourable to rapid iterations. :ref:`MultiMeshInstance "
"<class_MultiMeshInstance>` is one of the possible solutions to this problem."
