"The navigation debug visualization is enabled by default inside the Editor. "
"To visualize navigation meshes and connections also at runtime enable the "
"option ``Visible Navigation`` in the editor debug menu."

"In Godot debug builds the navigation debug can also be toggled on the "

msgid ""
"The appearance of navigation debug can be change in the ProjectSettings "
"under ``debug/shapes/navigation``. Certain debug features can also be "
"enabled or disabled at will but may require a scene restart to apply."

msgid ""
"If ``enable_edge_lines`` is enabled the edges of navigation mesh polygons "
"will be highlighted. If ``enable_edge_lines_xray`` is also enabled the edges "
"of navigationmeshes will be visible through geometry."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"if ``enable_geometry_face_random_color`` is enabled each navigation mesh "
"face receives a random color that is mixed with the main color from "

msgid "Debug edge connections"
msgstr "デバッグメニューオプション"

msgid ""
"Different navigation meshes connected within ``edge_connection_margin`` "
"distance are overlaid. The color of the overlay is controlled with the "
"navigation debug ``edge_connection_color``. The connections can be made "
"visible through geometry with the navigation debug "
"``enable_edge_connections_xray`` property."

msgid "Debug Performance"
msgstr "パフォーマンス"

msgid ""
"To measure NavigationServer performance a dedicated monitor exists that can "
"be found within the Editor Debugger under `Debugger->Monitors-"
">NavigationProcess`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"NavigationProcess shows how long the NavigationServer spends updating its "
"internals this update frame in milliseconds. NavigationProcess works similar "
"to Process for visual frame rendering and PhysicsProcess for collision and "
"fixed updates."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"NavigationProcess accounts for all updates to ``navigation maps``, "
"``navigation regions`` and ``navigation agents`` as well as all the "
"``avoidance calculations`` for the update frame."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"NavigationProcess does NOT include pathfinding performance cause pathfinding "
"operates on the navigation map data independently from the server process "
"update."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"NavigationProcess should be in general kept as low and as stable as possible "
"for runtime performance to avoid frame rate issues. Note that since the "
"NavigationServer process update happens in the middle of the physics update "
"an increase in NavigationProcess will automatically increase PhysicsProcess "
"by the same amount."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Navigation also provides more detailed statistics about the current "
"navigation related objects and navigation map composition on the "
"NavigationServer."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Navigation statistics shown here can not be judged as good or bad for "
"performance as it depends entirely on the project what can be considered as "
"reasonable or horribly excessive."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Navigation statistics help with identifying performance bottlenecks that are "
"less obvious because the source might not always have a visible "
"representation. E.g. pathfinding performance issues created by overly "
"detailed navigation meshes with thousand of edges / polygons or problems "
"caused by procedural navigation gone wrong."
