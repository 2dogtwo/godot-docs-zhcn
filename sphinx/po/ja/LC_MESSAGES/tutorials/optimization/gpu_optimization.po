"The demand for new graphics features and progress almost guarantees that you "
"will encounter graphics bottlenecks. Some of these can be CPU side, for "
"instance in calculations inside the Godot engine to prepare objects for "
"rendering. Bottlenecks can also occur on the CPU in the graphics driver, "
"which sorts instructions to pass to the GPU, and in the transfer of these "
"instructions. And finally bottlenecks also occur on the GPU itself."

"Godot sends instructions to the GPU via a graphics API (OpenGL, GLES2, "
