"This lesson will give you an overview of the available scripting languages "
"in Godot. You will learn the pros and cons of each option. In the next part, "
"you will write your first script using GDScript."

"**Scripts attach to a node and extend its behavior**. This means that "
"scripts inherit all functions and properties of the node they attach to."

"For example, take a game where a Camera2D node follows a ship. The Camera2D "
"node follows its parent by default. Imagine you want it to shake when the "
"player takes damage. As this feature is not built-into Godot, you would "
"attach a script to it and code the camera shake."

"Godot offers **five gameplay programming languages**: GDScript, C#, "
"VisualScript, and C++ and C via its GDNative technology. There are more :ref:"
"`community-supported languages <doc_what_is_gdnative_third_party_bindings>`, "
"but these are the official ones."

msgid ""
"You can use multiple languages in a single project. For instance, in a team, "
"you could code gameplay logic in GDScript as it's fast to write, let level "
"designers script quests in the graphical language VisualScript, and use C# "
"or C++ to implement complex algorithms and maximize their performance. Or "
"you can write everything in GDScript or C#. It's your call."

msgid "Which language should I use?"

msgid ""
"If you're a beginner, we recommend to **start with GDScript**. We made this "
"language specifically for Godot and the needs of game developers. It has a "
"lightweight and straightforward syntax and provides the tightest integration "
"with Godot."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For C#, you will need an external code editor like `VSCode <https://code."
"visualstudio.com/>`_ or Visual Studio. While C# support is now mature, you "
"will also find fewer learning resources for it compared to GDScript. That's "
"why we recommend C# mainly to users who already have experience with the "
"language."

"No `garbage collection <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"

"you need to."

"`Gradual typing <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradual_typing>`_. Variables "

"GDScript looks like Python as you structure your code blocks using "

"multiple languages, including Squirrel, Lua, and Python."

msgid "Why don't we use Python or Lua directly?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Years ago, Godot used Python, then Lua. Both languages' integration took a "
"lot of work and had severe limitations. For example, threading support was a "
"big challenge with Python."

msgid ""
"Developing a dedicated language doesn't take us more work and we can tailor "

"GDScript code itself doesn't execute as fast as compiled C# or C++. However, "

":ref:`Visual Scripting<doc_what_is_visual_script>` is a graph-based visual "

"You can use other languages to create custom blocks that are specific to "

"While it provides all the basic building blocks you need to code complete "
