"Creating a single scene and adding nodes into it might work for small "
"projects, but as a project grows in size and complexity, the number of nodes "
"can quickly become unmanageable. To address this, Godot allows a project to "
"be separated into any number of scenes. This provides you with a powerful "
"tool that helps you organize the different components of your game."
