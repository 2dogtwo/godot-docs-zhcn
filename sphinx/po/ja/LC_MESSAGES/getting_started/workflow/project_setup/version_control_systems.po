"Godot aims to be VCS friendly and generate mostly readable and mergeable "
"files. Godot also supports the use of version control systems in the editor "
"itself. However, VCS in the editor requires a plugin for the specific VCS "
"you are using. VCS can be setup or shut down in the editor under **Project > "
"Version Control**."
