"The export dialog gives you the option to encrypt your scripts with an "
"256bit AES key, when releasing your game. This will make sure your scripts "
"are not stored in plain text and can not easily be ripped by some script "
"kiddie. Of course the key needs to be stored in the binary, but if it's "
"compiled, optimized and without symbols, it would take some effort to find "
"it."
