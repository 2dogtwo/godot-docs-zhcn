"Accessing project files can be done by opening any path with ``res://`` as a "

"While the project is running, it is a common scenario that the resource path "

"In some devices (for example, mobile ad consoles) this path is unique for "
"the app. Under desktop operating systems, the engine uses the typical ``~/."
"local/share/godot/app_userdata/Name`` (check the project name under the "
"settings) in macOS and Linux, and ``APPDATA/Name`` for Windows."
