"So far, :ref:`Nodes <class_Node>` have been the most important datatype in "

"through them. There is another datatype that is equally important: :ref:"
"`Resource <class_Resource>`."

"When Godot saves or loads (from disk) a scene (.tscn or .scn), an image "

"When a resource is loaded from disk, **it is always loaded once**. That "
"means, if there is a copy of that resource already loaded in memory, trying "
"to load the resource again will return the same copy again and again. This "
"corresponds with the fact that resources are just data containers, so there "
"is no need to have them duplicated."

"Typically, every object in Godot (Node, Resource, or anything else) can "
"export properties. Properties can be of many types (like a string, integer, "
"Vector2, etc) and one of those types can be a resource. This means that both "
"nodes and resources can contain resources as properties. To make it a little "

"For example, if the path \\`\"res://robi.png\"\\` is erased from the \"path"
"\" property in the above example, and then the scene is saved, the resource "
"will be saved inside the .tscn scene file, no longer referencing the "
"external \"robi.png\". However, even if saved as built-in, and even though "
"the scene can be instanced multiple times, the resource will always be "
"loaded only once. That means, different Robi robot scenes instanced at the "
"same time will still share the same image."

"Scenes are also resources, but there is a catch. Scenes saved to disk are "

"the scene is packed inside a resource."
msgstr ""

"To obtain an instance of the scene, the method :ref:`PackedScene.instance() "

"This method creates the nodes in the scene's hierarchy, configures them "

"The approach has several advantages. As the :ref:`PackedScene.instance() "
"<class_PackedScene_instance>` function is pretty fast, adding extra content "
"to the scene can be done efficiently. New enemies, bullets, effects, etc can "
"be added or removed quickly, without having to load them again from disk "
"each time. It is important to remember that, as always, images, meshes, etc "
