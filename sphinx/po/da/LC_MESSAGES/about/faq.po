"The short answer is that we think the additional complexity both on your "

"(maintenance) is worth the more integrated and seamless experience over "
"attracting additional users with more familiar programming languages that "
"result in a worse experience. We understand if you would rather use another "
"language in Godot (see list of supported options above), but we strongly "
"encourage you to try it and see the benefits for yourself."
msgstr ""
"Det korte svar er, at vi tror den ekstra kompleksitet både på din side (når "
"du første gang lærer Godot og GDScript) samt vores side (vedligeholdelse) er "
"den mere integrerede og problemfri oplevelse værd, i stedet for at tiltrække "
"yderligere brugere ved integrering af mere kendte programmeringssprog, der "
"resulterer i en dårligere oplevelse. Vi forstår, hvis du hellere vil bruge "
