msgid ""
"A navigation mesh only describes a traversable area for an agent's center "
"position. Any radius values an agent may have are ignored. If you want "
"pathfinding to account for an agent's (collision) size you need to shrink "
"the navigation mesh accordingly."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Navigation works independently from other engine parts like rendering or "
"physics. Navigation meshes are the only things considered when doing "
"pathfinding, e.g. visuals and collision shapes for example are completely "
"ignored by the navigation system. If you need to take other data (like "
"visuals for example) into account when doing pathfinding, you need to adapt "
"your navigation meshes accordingly. The process of factoring in navigation "
"restrictions in navigation meshes is commonly referred to as navigation mesh "
"baking."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you experience clipping or collision problems while following navigation "
"paths, always remember that you need to tell the navigation system what your "
"intentions are through an appropriate navigation mesh. By itself the "
"navigation system will never know \"this is a tree / rock / wall collision "
"shape or visual mesh\" because it only knows that \"here I was told I can "
"path safely because it is on a navigation mesh\"."

msgid "Creating 2D navigation meshes"

msgid ""
"Navigation meshes in the 2D editor are created with the help of the "
"NavigationPolygon draw tools that appear in the top bar of the editor when a "
"NavigationRegion2D is selected."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The NavigationPolygon draw tools can be used to create and edit navigation "
"meshes by defining **outline** polygons. The outline polygons are later "
"converted to real navigation mesh resources for the NavigationServer regions."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Multiple outlines can be added to the same NavigationPolygon resource as "
"long as they **do not intersect or overlap**. Each additional outline will "
"cut a hole in the polygon created by the larger outline. If the larger "
"polygon is already a hole, it will create a new navigation mesh polygon "
"inside."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Outlines are not a replacement if the intention is to merge aligned polygons "
"e.g. from grid cells. Outlines, as the name would suggest, cannot intersect "
"each other or have any overlapping vertex positions."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Outline layouts like seen in this picture will fail the convex partitioning "
"required by the navigation mesh generation. In these layout cases, the "
"outline tool cannot be used. Use the :ref:`Geometry2D<class_Geometry2D>` "
"class to merge or intersect polygons to create a merged mesh that is valid "
"for navigation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The NavigationServer does not connect navigation mesh islands from the same "
"navigation mesh resource. Do not create multiple disconnected islands in the "
"same NavigationRegion2D or NavigationPolygon resource if they should be "
"later connected."

msgid ""
"For 2D, no similar navigation mesh baking with geometry parsing exists like "
"in 3D. The Geometry2D class functions for offset, merge, intersect, and clip "
"can be used to shrink or enlarge existing NavigationPolygons for different "
"actor sizes."

"Navigation meshes in the 3D editor are created with the help of the :ref:"
"`NavigationMeshGenerator<class_NavigationMeshGenerator>` singleton and the "
"NavigationMesh bake settings that appear in the editor inspector."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Navigation mesh baking is the process of creating a simplified mesh used for "
"pathfinding out of (complex) 3D level geometry. For this process Godot "
"parses scene geometry and hands the raw mesh or collision data to the third-"
"party ReCast library for processing and creation of the final navigation "
"mesh."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The resulting navigation mesh is an approximation of the source geometry "
"surfaces for both performance and technical reasons. Do not expect the "
"navigation mesh to perfectly follow the original surfaces. Especially "
"navigation polygons placed over ramps will not keep an equal distance to the "
"ground surface. To align an actor perfectly with the ground use other means "
"like physics."

"Meshes need to be triangulated to work as navigation meshes. Other mesh face "
"formats like quad or ngon are not supported."

msgid "NavigationMesh rebaking at runtime"
msgstr "NavigationMeshes"

msgid ""
"To rebake a ``NavigationMesh`` at runtime, use the ``NavigationRegion3D."
"bake_navigation_mesh()`` function. Another option is to use the "
"``NavigationMeshGenerator.bake()`` singleton function with the "
"NavigationMesh resource directly. If the NavigationMesh resource is already "
"prepared, the region can be updated with the NavigationServer3D API directly "
"as well."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Baking a NavigationMesh at runtime is a costly operation. A complex "
"navigation mesh takes some time to bake and if done on the main thread can "
"freeze a game. (Re)baking a large navigation mesh is preferably done in a "
"separate thread."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Property values on a NavigationMesh resource like ``cell_size`` need to "
"match the actual mesh data stored inside in order to merge different "
"navigation meshes without issues."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"NavigationRegion2D and NavigationRegion3D both use meshes to mark "
"traversable areas, only the tools to create them are different."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For 2D, NavigationPolygon resources are used to draw outline points in the "
"editor. From these outline points the NavigationServer2D creates a mesh to "
"upload navigation data to the NavigationServer."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For 3D, NavigationMesh resources are used. Instead of providing draw tools "
"the 3D variant provides an extensive amount of parameters to bake a "
"navigation mesh directly from 3D source geometry."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Technically there is no hard distinction between 2D and 3D on how to use the "
"given toolsets to create flat navigation meshes. The 2D drawing tool can be "
"used to create a flat 3D navigation mesh and the 3D baking tool can be used "
"to parse flat 3D geometry into appropriate 2D navigation meshes."
