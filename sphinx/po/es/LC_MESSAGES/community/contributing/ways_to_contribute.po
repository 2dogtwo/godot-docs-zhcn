"**Be part of the community.** The best way to contribute to Godot and help "
"it become ever better is simply to use the engine and promote it by word-of-"
"mouth, in the credits or splash screen of your games, blog posts, tutorials, "
"videos, demos, gamedev or free software events, support on the Q&A, IRC, "
"forums, Discord, etc. Participate! Being a user and advocate helps spread "
"the word about our great engine, which has no marketing budget and can "
"therefore only rely on its community to become more mainstream."

"**Make games.** It's no secret that, to convince new users and especially "
"the industry at large that Godot is a relevant market player, we need great "
"games made with Godot. We know that the engine has a lot of potential, both "

"will draw attention to Godot. So keep working on your awesome projects, each "

"**Donate.** Godot is a non-profit project, but it can still benefit from "
"user donations for many things. Apart from usual expenses such as hosting "
"costs or promotion material on events, we also use donation money to acquire "
"hardware when necessary (e.g. we used donation money to buy a Macbook Pro to "
"implement Retina/HiDPI support and various other macOS-related features). "
"Most importantly, we also used donation money to hire core developers so "
"they can work full-time on the engine. Even with a low monthly wage, we need "
"a steady donation income to continue doing this, which has been very "
"beneficial to the project so far. So if you want to donate some money to the "
"project, check `our website <https://godotengine.org/donate>`_ for details."
