"In the previous part, we saw that a scene is a collection of nodes organized "
"in a tree structure, with a single node as its root. You can split your "
"project into any number of scenes. This feature helps you break down and "
"organize your game's different components."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can create as many scenes as you'd like and save them to the disk with "
"the ``.tscn`` extension, which stands for \"text scene\". The ``Label.tscn`` "
"file from the previous lesson was an example. We call those files \"Packed "
"Scenes\" as they pack information about your scene's content."

"Here's the example of a ball. It's composed of a :ref:`RigidBody2D "
"<class_RigidBody2D>` node as its root named Ball, which allows the ball to "
"fall and bounce on walls, a :ref:`Sprite2D <class_Sprite>` node, and a :ref:"
"`CollisionShape2D <class_CollisionShape2D>`."

msgid ""
"Once you saved a scene, it works as a blueprint: you can reproduce it in "
"other scenes as many times as you'd like. Replicating an object from a "
"template like so is called **instancing**."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As we mentioned in the previous part, instanced scenes behave like a node: "
"the editor hides their content by default. When you instance the Ball, you "
"only see the Ball node. Notice also how each duplicate has a unique name."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Every instance of the Ball scene starts with the same structure and "
"properties as ``Ball.tscn``. However, you can modify each independently, "
"such as changing how they bounce, how heavy they are, or any property "
"exposed by the source scene."

"If you change a value on the ``PhysicsMaterial`` of one instance, it will "

"Instances and scenes in Godot offer an excellent design language, setting "

msgid ""
"We recommend dismissing architectural code patterns when making games with "
"Godot, such as Model-View-Controller (MVC) or Entity-Relationship diagrams. "
"Instead, you can start by imagining the elements players will see in your "

"Once you have a diagram, we recommended creating a scene for each element "

"Cuando tengas un diagrama como este, el proceso recomendado para hacer un "

"Programmers tend to spend a lot of time designing abstract architectures and "
"trying to fit components into it. Designing based on scenes makes "
"development faster and more straightforward, allowing you to focus on the "
"game logic itself. Because most game components map directly to a scene, "
"using a design based on scene instantiation means you need little other "
"architectural code."
msgstr ""
"Gran parte del tiempo dedicado a programar juegos (o software en general) se "
"destina a diseñar una arquitectura y ajustar componentes del juego a esa "
"arquitectura. Diseñar en base a escenas reemplaza ese enfoque y hace el "
"desarrollo mucho más rápido y directo, permitiéndote concentrarte en la "
"lógica misma del juego. Como la mayoría de los componentes se relacionan "
"directamente con una escena, usar un diseño basado en instanciación de "
"escenas implica muy poco código arquitectural adicional."

"Imagine we started by creating the room. We could make a couple of different "
"room scenes, with unique arrangements of furniture in them. Later, we could "
"make a house scene that uses multiple room instances for the interior. We "
"would create a citadel out of many instanced houses and a large terrain on "
"which we would place the citadel. Each of these would be a scene instancing "
"one or more sub-scenes."

"Later, we could create scenes representing guards and add them to the "
"citadel. They would be indirectly added to the overall game world."

"Más adelante, podrímos crear escenas que representasen guardias (y otros "
"NPCs) y también añadirlos a la ciudadela. Como resultado, se añadirían "
"indirectamente al mundo del juego en general."

"With Godot, it's easy to iterate on your game like this, as all you need to "
"do is create and instantiate more scenes. We designed the editor to be "
"accessible to programmers, designers, and artists alike. A typical team "
"development process can involve 2D or 3D artists, level designers, game "
"designers, and animators, all working with the Godot editor."
msgstr ""
"Con Godot, es fácil iterar en tu juego de esta manera, ya que todo lo que "
"necesitas hacer es crear e instanciar más escenas. Además, la interfaz UI "
"del editor está diseñada para que sea fácil de usar tanto para programadores "
"como para no programadores. Un proceso típico de desarrollo en equipo puede "
"involucrar artistas 2D o 3D, diseñadores de nivel, diseñadores de juegos y "
"animadores, todos trabajando con la interfaz del editor."
