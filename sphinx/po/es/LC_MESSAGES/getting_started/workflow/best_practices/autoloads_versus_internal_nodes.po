"Other engines might encourage the use of creating \"manager\" classes that "
"organize lots of functionality into a globally accessible entity. Godot "
"thrives by supporting ways to cut down the size of such objects. Instead it "
"shifts content into individual nodes as much as possible."

"For example, what if a developer is building a platformer and they want to "
"collect coins that play a sound effect? Well, there's a node for that: the :"
"ref:`AudioStreamPlayer <class_AudioStreamPlayer>`. But they notice during "
"their testing that if they \"play\" an AudioStreamPlayer while it is already "
"playing the sound, then the new sound interrupts the first sound, "
"terminating it before it can play."

"Users tend to think the best solution is to make the whole system smarter by "
"making a SoundManager autoload node. It generates a pool of "
"AudioStreamPlayers that cycle through as each new request for sound effects "
"comes in. They then make this SoundManager an autoload so that they can "
"access it from anywhere with `SFX.play(\"coin_pickup.ogg\")`. Little do they "
"know, they've invited a great many complications into their code."

"have each object that needs an AudioStreamPlayer register exactly how many "

"**Static Data**: if you need static data, i.e. data that should be "
"associated with a class (so there is only ever one copy of the data), then "
"autoloads are good opportunities for that. Static data doesn't exist in "
"Godot's scripting API, so autoload singletons are the next best thing. If "
"one creates a class as an autoload, and never creates another copy of that "
"class within a scene, then it will function in place of a formal singleton "
"API."

msgid ""
"**Convenience**: autoloaded nodes have a global variable for their name "
"generated in GDScript. This can be very convenient for defining objects that "
"should always exist, but which need object instance information. The "
"alternative is to create a namespace script: a script that's purpose is only "
"to load and create constants to access other Script or PackedScene "
"resources, resulting in something like ``MyAutoload.MyNode.new()``."

"Note that the introduction of script classes in Godot 3.1 questions the "
"validity of this reason. With them, one can access scripts using an explicit "
"name from GDScript. Using an autoload to get to a namespace script becomes "
"unnecessary, e.g. ``MyScriptClass.MyPreloadedScript.new()``."

"If the singleton is managing its own information and not invading the data "
"of other objects, then it's a great way to create a \"system\" class that "
"handles a broad-scoped task. For example a targeting system, quest system, "
"or dialogue system would be great use cases of singleton implementations."
