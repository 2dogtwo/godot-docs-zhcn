"Since Godot has no restrictions on project structure or filesystem usage, "
"organizing files when learning the engine can seem challenging. This "
"tutorial suggests a workflow which should be a good starting point. We will "
"also cover using version control with Godot."

"Godot is scene-based in nature, and uses the filesystem as-is, without "
"metadata or an asset database."

"Unlike other engines, many resources are contained within the scene itself, "
"so the amount of files in the filesystem is considerably lower."

"Considering that, the most common approach is to group assets as close to "
"scenes as possible; when a project grows, it makes it more maintainable."

"As an example, one can usually place into a single folder their basic "
"assets, such as sprite images, 3D model meshes, materials, and music, etc. "
"They can then use a separate folder to store built levels that use them."

"Godot versions prior to 3.0 did the import process from files outside the "

"organization hassle for most developers."

"To prevent Godot from importing files contained in a specific folder, create "
"an empty file called ``.gdignore`` in the folder (the leading ``.`` is "
"required). This can be useful to speed up the initial project importing."

"Ignoring a folder will also automatically hide it from the FileSystem dock, "
