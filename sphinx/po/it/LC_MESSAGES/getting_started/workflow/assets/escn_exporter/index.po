"If you have hundreds of model files, you don't want your artists to waste "
"time manually exporting their blend files. To combat this, the exporter "
"provides a python function ``io_scene_godot.export(out_file_path)`` that can "
"be called to export a file. This allows easy integration with other build "
"systems. An example Makefile and python script that exports all the blends "
"in a directory are present in the Godot-Blender-exporter repository."
