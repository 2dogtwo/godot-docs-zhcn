"A file system manages how assets are stored and how they are accessed. A "
"well-designed file system also allows multiple developers to edit the same "
"source files and assets while collaborating. Godot stores all assets as "
"files in its file system."

"The file system stores resources on disk. Anything, from a script, to a "
"scene or a PNG image is a resource to the engine. If a resource contains "
"properties that reference other resources on disk, the paths to those "
"resources are also included. If a resource has sub-resources that are built-"
"in, the resource is saved in a single file together with all the bundled sub-"
"resources. For example, a font resource is often bundled together with the "
"font textures."

"Writing to disk is still needed for tasks such as saving game state or "

"Alternatively host file system paths can also be used, but this is not "

msgid ""
"There are some drawbacks to this simple file system design. The first issue "
"is that moving assets around (renaming them or moving them from one path to "
"another inside the project) will break existing references to these assets. "
"These references will have to be re-defined to point at the new asset "
"location."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/step_by_step/filesystem.rst:98
msgid ""
"To avoid this, do all your move, delete and rename operations from within "
"Godot, on the FileSystem dock. Never move assets from outside Godot, or "
"dependencies will have to be fixed manually (Godot detects this and helps "
"you fix them anyway, but why go the hard route?)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/step_by_step/filesystem.rst:103
msgid ""
"The second is that, under Windows and macOS, file and path names are case "
"insensitive. If a developer working in a case insensitive host file system "
"saves an asset as ``myfile.PNG``, but then references it as ``myfile.png``, "
"it will work fine on their platform, but not on other platforms, such as "
"Linux, Android, etc. This may also apply to exported binaries, which use a "
"compressed package to store all files."

msgid ""
"It is recommended that your team clearly define a naming convention for "
"files when working with Godot. One simple fool-proof convention is to only "
"allow lowercase file and path names."
