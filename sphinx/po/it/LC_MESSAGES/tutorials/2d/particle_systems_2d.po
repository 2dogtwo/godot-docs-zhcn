"The idea is that a \"particle\" is emitted at a fixed interval and with a "
"fixed lifetime. During its lifetime, every particle will have the same base "
"behavior. What makes each particle different from the rest and provides a "
"more organic look is the \"randomness\" associated with each parameter. In "
"essence, creating a particle system means setting base physics parameters "
"and then adding randomness to them."

"Godot provides two different nodes for 2D particles, :ref:"
"`class_Particles2D` and :ref:`class_CPUParticles2D`. Particles2D is more "
"advanced and uses the GPU to process particle effects, but that limits it to "
"higher end graphics API, and in our case to the GLES3 renderer. For projects "
"using the GLES2 backend, CPUParticles2D is a CPU-driven option with near "
"feature parity with Particles2D, but lesser performance. While Particles2D "
"is configured via a :ref:`class_ParticlesMaterial` (and optionally with a "
"custom shader), the matching options are provided via node properties in "
"CPUParticles2D (with the exception of the trail settings). You can convert a "
"Particles2D node into a CPUParticles2D node by clicking on the node in the "
"inspector, and selecting \"Convert to CPUParticles2D\" in the \"Particles\" "
"menu of the toolbar."

"per elaborare gli effetti delle particelle, ma ciò lo limita all'API grafica "

"utilizzano il backend GLES2, CPUParticles2D è un'opzione guidata dalla CPU "
"con parità di funzionalità vicina a Particles2D, ma con prestazioni "
"inferiori. Mentre Particles2D è configurato tramite a :ref: "
"`class_ParticlesMaterial` (e facoltativamente con uno shader "

"proprietà del nodo in CPUParticles2D (ad eccezione delle impostazioni del "
