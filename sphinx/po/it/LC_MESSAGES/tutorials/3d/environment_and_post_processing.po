"Even though, in most cases, lighting and texturing are heavily artist "

"The simplest way to use auto exposure is to make sure outdoor lights (or "

"**Energy** multiplier (on the Light itself). To make it consistent, the "
"**Sky** usually needs to use the energy multiplier too, to match with the "

"As mentioned in the **Ambient** section, areas where light from light nodes "
