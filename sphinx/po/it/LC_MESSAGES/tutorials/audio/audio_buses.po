"Godot's audio engine allows any number of audio buses to be created and any "
"number of effect processors can be added to each bus. Only the hardware of "
"the device running your game will limit the number of buses and effects that "

"Godot's sound interface is designed to meet the expectations of sound design "
"professionals. To this end it primarily uses the decibel scale."

msgid "For those unfamiliar with it, it can be explained with a few facts:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/audio/audio_buses.rst:21
msgid ""
"The decibel (dB) scale is a relative scale. It represents the ratio of sound "
"power by using 10 times the base 10 logarithm of the ratio (10Ã—log\\ :sub:"
"`10`\\ (P/P\\ :sub:`0`\\ ))."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/audio/audio_buses.rst:22
msgid ""
"For every 3dB, sound amplitude doubles or halves. 6dB represents a factor of "
"4, 9dB a factor of 8, 10dB a factor of 10, 20dB a factor of 100, etc."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/audio/audio_buses.rst:23
msgid ""
"Since the scale is logarithmic, true zero (no audio) can't be represented."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/audio/audio_buses.rst:24
msgid ""
"0dB is the maximum amplitude possible in a digital audio system. This limit "
"is not the human limit, but a limit from the sound hardware. Audio with "
"amplitudes that are too high to be represented properly below 0dB create a "
"kind of distortion called clipping."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/audio/audio_buses.rst:25
msgid ""
"To avoid clipping, your sound mix be arranged so that the output of the "
"*Master Bus* (more on that later) never exceeds 0dB."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/audio/audio_buses.rst:26
msgid ""
"Every 3dB below the 0dB limit, sound energy is *halved*. It means the sound "
"volume at -3dB is half as loud as 0dB. -6dB is half as loud as -3dB and so "
"on."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/audio/audio_buses.rst:27
msgid ""
"When working with decibels, sound is considered no longer audible between "
"-60dB and -80dB. This makes your working range generally between -60dB and "
"0dB."

"An *Audio Bus* (also called an *Audio Channel*) can be considered a place "
"that audio is channeled through on the way to playback through a device's "
"speakers. Audio data can be *modified* and *re-routed* by an *Audio Bus*. An "
"*Audio Bus* has a VU meter (the bars that light up when sound is played) "
"which indicates the amplitude of the signal passing through."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/audio/audio_buses.rst:40
msgid ""
"The leftmost bus is the *Master Bus*. This bus outputs the mix to your "
"speakers so, as mentioned in the item above (Decibel Scale), make sure that "
"your mix level doesn't reach 0dB in this bus. The rest of the audio buses "
"can be flexibly routed. After modifying the sound, they send it to another "
"bus to the left. The destination bus can be specified for each of the non-"
"master audio buses. Routing always passes audio from buses on the right to "
"buses further to the left. This avoids infinite routing loops."

#: ../../docs/tutorials/audio/audio_buses.rst:71
msgid ""
"Amplify changes the amplitude of the signal. Some care needs to be taken. "

msgid "BandLimit and BandPass"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/audio/audio_buses.rst:76
msgid ""
"These are resonant filters which block frequencies around the *Cutoff* "
"point. BandPass can be used to simulate sound passing through an old "
"telephone line or megaphone. Modulating the BandPass frequency can simulate "
"the sound of a wah-wah guitar pedal, think of the guitar in Jimi Hendrix's "
"*Voodoo Child (Slight Return)*."
msgstr ""

msgid "Chorus"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/audio/audio_buses.rst:81
msgid ""
"The Chorus effect duplicates the incoming audio, delays the duplicate "
"slightly and uses an LFO to continuously modulate the pitch of the "
"duplicated signal before mixing the duplicatated signal(s) and the original "
"together again. This creates a shimmering effect and adds stereo width to "
"the sound."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/audio/audio_buses.rst:84
msgid "Compressor"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/audio/audio_buses.rst:86
msgid ""
"A dynamic range compressor automatically attenuates the level of the "
"incoming signal when its amplitude exceeds a certain threshold. The level of "
"attenuation applied is proportional to how far the incoming audio exceeds "
"the threshold. The compressor's Ratio parameter controls the degree of "
"attenuation. One of the main uses of a compressor is to reduce the dynamic "
"range of signals with very loud and quiet parts. Reducing the dynamic range "
"of a signal can make it easier to mix."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/audio/audio_buses.rst:89
msgid "The compressor has many uses. For example:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/audio/audio_buses.rst:91
msgid "It can be used in the Master bus to compress the whole output."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/audio/audio_buses.rst:92
msgid ""
"It can be used in voice channels to ensure they sound as even as possible."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/audio/audio_buses.rst:93
msgid ""
"It can be *Sidechained*. This means it can reduce the sound level of one "
"signal using the level of another audio bus for threshold detection. This "
"technique is very common in video game mixing to 'duck' the level of music "
"or sound effects when voices need to be heard."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/audio/audio_buses.rst:94
msgid ""
"It can accentuate transients by using a slower attack. This can make sound "
"effects more punchy."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/audio/audio_buses.rst:98
msgid ""
"If your goal is to prevent a signal from exceeding a given amplitude "
"altogether, rather that to reduce the dynamic range       of the signal, a "
"limiter is likely a better choice than a compressor. See below."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/audio/audio_buses.rst:102
msgid "Delay"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/audio/audio_buses.rst:104
msgid ""
"Adds an \"Echo\" effect with a feedback loop. It can be used, together with "
"Reverb, to simulate wide rooms, canyons, etc. where sound bounces are far "
"apart."
msgstr ""

msgid "Distortion"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/audio/audio_buses.rst:109
msgid ""
"Distortion effects make the sound 'dirty'. Godot offers several types of "
"distortion: Overdrive, tan and bit crushing. Distortion can be used simulate "
"sound coming through a low-quality speaker or device."

msgid "EQ, EQ6, EQ10, EQ21"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/audio/audio_buses.rst:115
msgid ""
"Godot provides four equalizers with different numbers of bands. An equalizer "
"on the master bus can be useful to cut frequencies that the device's "
"speakers can't reproduce well (e.g. a mobile phone's speakers won't "
"reproduce bass content well). The equalizer effect can be disabled when "
"headphones are plugged in."

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/audio/audio_buses.rst:125

"These are filters that cut frequencies below a specific *Cutoff* frequency. "
"HighPassFilter and HighShelfFilter are used to reduce the bass content of a "

msgid "Limiter"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/audio/audio_buses.rst:130
msgid ""
"A limiter is similar to a compressor, but it's less flexible and designed to "
"prevent a signal's amplitude exceeding a given dB threshold. Adding a "
"limiter to the *Master Bus* is a safeguard against clipping."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/audio/audio_buses.rst:133
msgid "LowPassFilter, LowShelfFilter"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/audio/audio_buses.rst:135
msgid ""
"These are the most common filters, they cut frequencies above a specific "
"*Cutoff* frequency and can also resonate (boost frequencies close to the "
"*Cutoff* frequency). Low pass filters can be used to simulate 'muffled' "
"sound. For instance underwater sound, sound blocked by walls, or distant "
"sound."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/audio/audio_buses.rst:138
msgid "NotchFilter"
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/audio/audio_buses.rst:150
msgid ""
"It probably does not make much sense to explain that this effect is formed "

msgid "PitchShift"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/audio/audio_buses.rst:155
msgid ""
"This effect allows the adjustment of the signal's pitch independently of its "
"speed. All frequencies can be increased/decreased with minimal effect on "
"transients. PitchShift can be useful to create unusually high or deep voices."

msgid "Bus rearrangement"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/tutorials/audio/audio_buses.rst:185
msgid ""
"Stream Players use bus names to identify a bus, which allows adding, "
"removing and moving buses around while the reference to them is kept. If a "
