"As you might have already read in :ref:`doc_audio_buses`, sound is sent to "
"each bus via an AudioStreamPlayer node. There are different kinds of "
"AudioStreamPlayers. Each one loads an AudioStream and plays it back."

"An audio stream is an abstract object that emits sound. The sound can come "
"from many places, but is most commonly loaded from the filesystem. Audio "
"files can be loaded as AudioStreams and placed inside an AudioStreamPlayer. "
"You can find information on supported formats and differences in :ref:"
"`doc_importing_audio_samples`."

"There are other types of AudioStreams, such as AudioStreamRandomPitch. This "
"one makes a random adjustment to the sound's pitch every time it's played "
"back. This can be helpful for adding variation to sounds that are played "
"back often."

"Area2Ds can be used to divert sound from any AudioStreamPlayer2Ds they "

"Godot allows for 3D audio streams that enter a specific Area node to send "
"dry and wet audio to separate buses. This is useful when you have several "
"reverb configurations for different types of rooms. This is done by enabling "
"this type of reverb in the **Reverb Bus** section of the Area's properties:"
msgstr ""

"At the same time, a special bus layout is created where each area receives "
"the reverb info from each area. A Reverb effect needs to be created and "
"configured in each reverb bus to complete the setup for the desired effect:"

#: ../../docs/tutorials/audio/audio_streams.rst:79
msgid ""
"The Area's **Reverb Bus** section also has a parameter named **Uniformity**. "
"Some types of rooms bounce sounds more than others (like a warehouse), so "
"reverberation can be heard almost uniformly across the room even though the "
"source may be far away. Playing around with this parameter can simulate that "
"effect."

"When the relative velocity between an emitter and listener changes, this is "
