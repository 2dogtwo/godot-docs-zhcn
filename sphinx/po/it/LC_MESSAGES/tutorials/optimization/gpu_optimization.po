"The demand for new graphics features and progress almost guarantees that you "
"will encounter graphics bottlenecks. Some of these can be CPU side, for "
"instance in calculations inside the Godot engine to prepare objects for "
"rendering. Bottlenecks can also occur on the CPU in the graphics driver, "
"which sorts instructions to pass to the GPU, and in the transfer of these "
"instructions. And finally bottlenecks also occur on the GPU itself."

"Understanding and investigating GPU bottlenecks is slightly different to the "

"indirectly, by changing the instructions you give to the GPU, and it may be "

"performance is by examining changes in frame rate."

"Godot sends instructions to the GPU via a graphics API (OpenGL, GLES2, "
"GLES3, Vulkan). The communication and driver activity involved can be quite "

"that is preferred by the driver and GPU, we can greatly increase performance."

"Nearly every API command in OpenGL requires a certain amount of validation, "

"together similar objects as much as possible so they can be rendered "
"together, or with the minimum number of these expensive state changes."

"In 3d, we still aim to minimize draw calls and state changes, however, it "
"can be more difficult to batch together several objects into a single draw "
"call. 3d meshes tend to comprise hundreds or thousands of triangles, and "
"combining large meshes at runtime is prohibitively expensive. The costs of "
"joining them quickly exceeds any benefits as the number of triangles grows "
"per mesh. A much better alternative is to join meshes ahead of time (static "
"meshes in relation to each other). This can either be done by artists, or "
"programmatically within Godot."

"There is also a cost to batching together objects in 3d. Several objects "
"rendered as one cannot be individually culled. An entire city that is off "
"screen will still be rendered if it is joined to a single blade of grass "
"that is on screen. So attempting to batch together 3d objects should take "
"account of their location and effect on culling. Despite this, the benefits "
"of joining static objects often outweigh other considerations, especially "

"Now all this is handled inside the GPU, so the performance is much higher. "
"3D artists usually have the wrong feeling about polycount performance "

"Using more power is not an option on mobile so mobile devices use a "

"result, fewer vertices and triangles can be processed for drawing."

"Additionally, Tile Based Rendering struggles when there are small objects "
