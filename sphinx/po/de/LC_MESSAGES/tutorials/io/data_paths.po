"For the sake of supporting as many platforms as possible, Godot only accepts "
"UNIX-style path separators (``/``). These work on all platforms, including "
"Windows."

"Accessing project files can be done by opening any path with ``res://`` as a "

"While the project is running, it is a common scenario that the resource path "
"will be read-only, due to it being inside a package, self-contained "
"executable, or system-wide install location."

"Storing persistent files in such scenarios should be done by using the "

"On some devices (for example, mobile and consoles), this path is unique to "
"the project. On desktop operating systems, the engine uses the typical ``~/."
"local/share/godot/app_userdata/Name`` on macOS and Linux, and ``%APPDATA%/"
"Name`` on Windows. ``Name`` is taken from the application name defined in "
"the Project Settings, but it can be overridden on a per-platform basis "
"using :ref:`feature tags <doc_feature_tags>`."
