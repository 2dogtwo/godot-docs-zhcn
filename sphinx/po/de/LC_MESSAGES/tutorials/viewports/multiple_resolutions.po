"However, what it does is not completely obvious; the engine will *not* "
"attempt to switch the monitor to this resolution. Rather, think of this "

"There are several types of devices, with several types of screens, which in "
"turn have different pixel density and resolutions. Handling all of them can "
"be a lot of work, so Godot tries to make the developer's life a little "
"easier. The :ref:`Viewport <class_Viewport>` node has several functions to "
"handle resizing, and the root node of the scene tree is always a viewport "
"(scenes loaded are instanced as a child of it, and it can always be accessed "
"by calling ``get_tree().get_root()`` or ``get_node(\"/root\")``)."

"In any case, while changing the root Viewport params is probably the most "
"flexible way to deal with the problem, it can be a lot of work, code and "
"guessing, so Godot provides a simple set of parameters in the project "
"settings to handle multiple resolutions."
