"Writing shaders can also be very difficult for people unfamiliar with them. "
"Godot tries to make writing shaders a little easier by exposing many useful "
"built-in features and handling some of the lower-level initialization work "
"for you. However, GLSL (the OpenGL Shading Language, which Godot uses) is "
"still unintuitive and restricting, especially for users who are used to "
"GDScript."

"Shaders are a special kind of program that runs on Graphics Processing Units "
"(GPUs). Most computers have some sort of GPU, either one integrated into "
"their CPU or discrete (meaning it is a separate hardware component, for "
"example, the typical graphics card). GPUs are especially useful for "
"rendering because they are optimized for running thousands of instructions "
"in parallel."

"The output of the shader is typically the colored pixels of the object drawn "
"to the viewport. But some shaders allow for specialized outputs (this is "
"especially true for APIs like Vulkan). Shaders operate inside the shader "
"pipeline. The standard process is the vertex -> fragment shader pipeline. "
"The vertex shader is used to decided where each vertex (point in a 3D model, "
"or corner of a Sprite) goes and the fragment shader decides what color "
"individual pixels receive."

"A consequence of the shader pipeline is that you cannot access the results "
"from a previous run of the shader, you cannot access other pixels from the "
"pixel being drawn, and you cannot write outside of the current pixel being "
"drawn. This enables the GPU to execute the shader for different pixels in "
"parallel, as they do not depend on each other. This lack of flexibility is "
"designed to work with the GPU which allows shaders to be incredibly fast."

"GPUs are able to render graphics much faster than CPUs for a few reasons, "
"but most notably, because they are able to run calculations massively in "
"parallel. A CPU typically has 4 or 8 cores while a GPU typically has "
"thousands. That means a GPU can do hundreds of tasks at once. GPU architects "
"have exploited this in a way that allows for doing many calculations very "
"quickly, but only when many or all cores are doing the same calculation at "
"once, but with different data."

"That is where shaders come in. The GPU will call the shader a bunch of times "
"simultaneously, and then operate on different bits of data (vertices, or "
"pixels). These bunches of data are often called wavefronts. A shader will "
"run the same for every thread in the wavefront. For example, if a given GPU "
"can handle 100 threads per wavefront, a wavefront will run on a 10x10 block "
"of pixels together. And it will continue to run for all pixels in that "
"wavefront until they are complete. Accordingly, if you have one pixel slower "
"than the rest (due to excessive branching), the entire block will be slowed "
"down, resulting in massively slower render times. This is different than CPU "
"based operations, on a CPU if you can speed up even one pixel the entire "
"rendering time will decrease. On a GPU, you have to speed up the entire "
"wavefront to speed up rendering."
