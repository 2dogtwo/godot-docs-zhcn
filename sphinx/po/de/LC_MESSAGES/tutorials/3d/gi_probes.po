"Just like with :ref:`doc_reflection_probes`, and as stated in the :ref:"
"`doc_spatial_material`, objects can show reflected or diffuse light. GI "
"Probes are similar to Reflection Probes, but they use a different and more "
"complex technique to produce indirect light and reflections."

"The strength of GI Probes is real-time, high quality, indirect light. While "
"the scene needs a quick pre-bake for the static objects that will be used, "
"lights can be added, changed or removed, and this will be updated in real-"
"time. Dynamic objects that move within one of these probes will also receive "
"indirect lighting from the scene automatically."
