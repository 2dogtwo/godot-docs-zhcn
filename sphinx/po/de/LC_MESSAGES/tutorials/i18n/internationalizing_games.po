"Sería excelente que el mundo hablara solo un idioma (It would be great if "
"the world spoke only one language). Unfortunately for us developers, that is "
"not the case. While indie or niche games usually do not need localization, "
"games targeting a more massive market often require localization. Godot "
"offers many tools to make this process more straightforward, so this "
"tutorial is more like a collection of tips and tricks."

"Localization is usually done by specific studios hired for the job and, "
"despite the huge amount of software and file formats available for this, the "
"most common way to do localization to this day is still with spreadsheets. "
"The process of creating the spreadsheets and importing them is already "
"covered in the :ref:`doc_importing_translations` tutorial, so this one could "
"be seen more like a follow-up to that one."
