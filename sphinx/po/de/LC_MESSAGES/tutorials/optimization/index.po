"Godot follows a balanced performance philosophy. In the performance world, "
"there are always trade-offs, which consist of trading speed for usability "
"and flexibility. Some practical examples of this are:"

"Rendering objects efficiently in high amounts is easy, but when a large "
"scene must be rendered, it can become inefficient. To solve this, visibility "
"computation must be added to the rendering, which makes rendering less "
"efficient, but, at the same time, fewer objects are rendered, so efficiency "
"overall improves."

"Configuring the properties of every material for every object that needs to "
"be rendered is also slow. To solve this, objects are sorted by material to "
"reduce the costs, but at the same time sorting has a cost."

"In 3D physics a similar situation happens. The best algorithms to handle "
"large amounts of physics objects (such as SAP) are slow at insertion/removal "
"of objects and ray-casting. Algorithms that allow faster insertion and "
"removal, as well as ray-casting, will not be able to handle as many active "
"objects."

"And there are many more examples of this! Game engines strive to be general "
"purpose in nature, so balanced algorithms are always favored over algorithms "
"that might be fast in some situations and slow in others or algorithms that "
"are fast but make usability more difficult."

"Godot is not an exception and, while it is designed to have backends "
"swappable for different algorithms, the default ones prioritize balance and "
"flexibility over performance."

"With this clear, the aim of this tutorial section is to explain how to get "
"the maximum performance out of Godot. While the tutorials can be read in any "
"order, it is a good idea to start from :ref:`doc_general_optimization`."
