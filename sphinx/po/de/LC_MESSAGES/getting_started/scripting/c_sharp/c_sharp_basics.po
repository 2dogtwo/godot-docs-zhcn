"C# is a high-level programming language developed by Microsoft. In Godot, it "

"C# 7.0. Mono is an open source implementation of Microsoft's .NET Framework "
"based on the ECMA standards for C# and the Common Language Runtime. A good "
"starting point for checking its capabilities is the `Compatibility <http://"
