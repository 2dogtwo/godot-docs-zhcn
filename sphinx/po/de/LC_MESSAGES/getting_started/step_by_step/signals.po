"Signals are Godot's version of the *observer* pattern. They allow a node to "
"send out a message that other nodes can listen for and respond to. For "
"example, rather than continuously checking a button to see if it's being "
"pressed, the button can emit a signal when it's pressed."

"Signals are a way to *decouple* your game objects, which leads to better "
"organized and more manageable code. Instead of forcing game objects to "
"expect other objects to always be present, they can instead emit signals "
"that any interested objects can subscribe to and respond."

"To see how signals work, let's try using a :ref:`Timer <class_Timer>` node. "
"Create a new scene with a Node and two children: a Timer and a :ref:`Sprite "
"<class_Sprite>`. You can use the Godot icon for the Sprite's texture, or any "
"other image you like. Attach a script to the root node, but don't add any "

"As another example of signal usage, let's consider a player character that "

"clicked, we create an instance of the bullet at the player's location. See :"
"ref:`doc_instancing` for details."

#: ../../docs/getting_started/step_by_step/signals.rst:215
msgid ""
"Instead, we need the bullets to be independent of the player's movement - "
"once fired, they should continue traveling in a straight line and the player "
"can no longer affect them. Instead of being added to the scene tree as a "
"child of the player, it makes more sense to add the bullet as a child of the "
"\"main\" game scene, which may be the player's parent or even further up the "
"tree."

msgid "You could do this by adding the bullet directly:"

#: ../../docs/getting_started/step_by_step/signals.rst:234
msgid ""
"However, this will lead to a different problem. Now if you try and test your "
"\"Player\" scene independently, it will crash on shooting, because there is "
"no parent node to access. This makes it a lot harder to test your player "
"code independently and also means that if you decide to change your main "
"scene's node structure, the player's parent may no longer be the appropriate "
"node to receive the bullets."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/step_by_step/signals.rst:241
msgid ""
"The solution to this is to use a signal to \"emit\" the bullets from the "
"player. The player then has no need to \"know\" what happens to the bullets "
"after that - whatever node is connected to the signal can \"receive\" the "
"bullets and take the appropriate action to spawn them."

msgid ""
"Many of Godot's built-in node types provide signals you can use to detect "
"events. For example, an :ref:`Area2D <class_Area2D>` representing a coin "
"emits a ``body_entered`` signal whenever the player's physics body enters "
"its collision shape, allowing you to know when the player collected it."

"In the next section, :ref:`doc_your_first_game`, you'll build a complete "
