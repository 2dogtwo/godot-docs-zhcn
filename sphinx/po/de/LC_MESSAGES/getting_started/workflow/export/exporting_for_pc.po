"The simplest way to distribute a game for PC is to copy the executables "
"(``godot.exe`` on Windows, ``godot`` on the rest), compress the folder and "

"Godot offers a more elegant approach for PC distribution when using the "
"export system. When exporting for PC (Linux, Windows, macOS), the exporter "
"takes all the project files and creates a ``data.pck`` file. This file is "
"bundled with a specially optimized binary that is smaller, faster and does "
"not contain the editor and debugger."
