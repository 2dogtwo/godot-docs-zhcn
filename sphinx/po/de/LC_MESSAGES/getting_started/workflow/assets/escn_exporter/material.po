"One way in which the exporter can handle materials is to attempt to match "
"the Blender material with an existing Godot material. This has the advantage "
"of being able to use all of the features of Godot's material system, but it "
"means that you cannot see your model with the material applied inside "
"Blender."

"To do this, the exporter attempts to find Godot materials with names that "
"match those of the material name in Blender. So if you export an object in "
"Blender with the material name ``PurpleDots`` then the exporter will search "
"for the file ``PurpleDots.tres`` and assign it to the object. If this file "
"is not a ``SpatialMaterial`` or ``ShaderMaterial`` or if it cannot be found, "
"then the exporter will fall back to exporting the material from Blender."
