"This is a `known bug <https://github.com/godotengine/godot/issues/20566>`__ "
"on Windows when you have specific USB peripherals connected. In particular, "
"Corsair's iCUE software seems to cause the bug. Try updating your USB "
"peripherals' drivers to their latest version. If the bug persists, you need "
"to disconnect the faulty peripherals before opening the editor. You can then "
"connect the peripheral again."

msgstr ""

"This is usually caused by forgetting to specify a filter for non-resource "
"files in the Export dialog. By default, Godot will only include actual "
"*resources* into the PCK file. Some files commonly used, such as JSON files, "
"are not considered resources. For example, if you load ``test.json`` in the "
"exported project, you need to specify ``*.json`` in the non-resource export "
"filter. See :ref:`doc_exporting_projects_export_mode` for more information."

"On Windows, this can also be due to :ref:`case sensitivity "
"<doc_project_organization_case_sensitivity>` issues. If you reference a "
"resource in your script with a different case than on the filesystem, "
"loading will fail once you export the project. This is because the virtual "
"PCK filesystem is case-sensitive, while Windows's filesystem is case-"
"insensitive by default."
