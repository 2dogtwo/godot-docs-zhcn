"Very often it is desired to make a shader that reads from the same screen "
"it's writing to. 3D APIs such as OpenGL or DirectX make this very difficult "
"because of internal hardware limitations. GPUs are extremely parallel, so "
"reading and writing causes all sort of cache and coherency problems. As a "
"result, not even the most modern hardware supports this properly."

"The workaround is to make a copy of the screen, or a part of the screen, to "
"a back-buffer and then read from it while drawing. Godot provides a few "
"tools that makes this process easy!"

"Godot :ref:`doc_shading_language` has a special texture, \"SCREEN_TEXTURE"
"\" (and \"DEPTH_TEXTURE\" for depth, in case of 3D). It takes as parameter "
"the UV of the screen and returns a vec3 RGB with the color. A special built-"
"in varying: SCREEN_UV can be used to obtain the UV for the current fragment. "
"As a result, this simple 2D fragment shader:"

"The reason why textureLod must be used is because, when Godot copies back a "
"chunk of the screen, it also does an efficient separatable gaussian blur to "
"it's mipmaps."

"While this seems magical, it's not. The SCREEN_TEXTURE built-in, when first "

"buffer. Subsequent nodes that use it in shaders will not have the screen "
"copied for them, because this ends up being inefficient."

"If a BackBufferCopy node was processed before the situation in the point "
"above (even if SCREEN_TEXTURE was not used), this behavior described in the "
"point above does not happen. In other words, automatic copying of the entire "
"screen only happens if SCREEN_TEXTURE is used in a node for the first time "
"and no BackBufferCopy node (not disabled) was found before in tree-order."

"BackBufferCopy can copy either the entire screen or a region. If set to only "
"a region (not the whole screen) and your shader uses pixels not in the "
"region copied, the result of that read is undefined (most likely garbage "
"from previous frames). In other words, it's possible to use BackBufferCopy "
"to copy back a region of the screen and then use SCREEN_TEXTURE on a "
"different region. Avoid this behavior!"
