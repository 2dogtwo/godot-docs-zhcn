"A plugin is a great way to extend the editor with useful tools. It can be "
"made entirely with GDScript and standard scenes, without even reloading the "
"editor. Unlike modules, you don't need to create C++ code nor recompile the "
"engine. While this makes plugins less powerful, there are still many things "
"you can do with them. Note that a plugin is similar to any scene you can "
"already make, except it is created using a script to add functionality."

"This tutorial will guide you through the creation of two simple plugins so "

"will be a custom node that you can add to any scene in the project and the "

"Sometimes you want a certain behavior in many nodes, such as a custom scene "

"(nodes or resources). However, before you can create the type, you need a "
