"Basically, drawing a shape on screen requires it to be decomposed into a "
"certain number of points linked from one to the following one. As you can "
"imagine, the more points your shape is made of, the smoother it will appear, "
"but the heavier it will also be in terms of processing cost. In general, if "
"your shape is huge (or in 3D, close to the camera), it will require more "
"points to be drawn without it being angular-looking. On the contrary, if "
"your shape is small (or in 3D, far from the camera), you may reduce its "
"number of points to save processing costs. This is called *Level of Detail "
"(LoD)*. In our example, we will simply use a fixed number of points, no "

"The reason why each angle is reduced by 90° is that we will compute 2D "
"positions out of each angle using trigonometry (you know, cosine and sine "
"stuff...). However, to be simple, cos() and sin() use radians, not degrees. "
"The angle of 0° (0 radian) starts at 3 o'clock although we want to start "

"The actual position of a point located on a circle at angle 'angle' (in "
"radians) is given by Vector2(cos(angle), sin(angle)). Since cos() and sin() "
"return values between -1 and 1, the position is located on a circle of "
"radius 1. To have this position on our support circle, which has a radius of "
"'radius', we simply need to multiply the position by 'radius'. Finally, we "
"need to position our support circle at the 'center' position, which is "
"performed by adding it to our Vector2 value. Finally, we insert the point in "
"the PoolVector2Array which was previously defined."

"Now, we need to actually draw our points. As you can imagine, we will not "

"of them. We could have computed every point ourselves using the previous "
"method, and drew it one by one. But this is too complicated and inefficient "
"(except if explicitly needed). So, we simply draw lines between each pair of "
"points. Unless the radius of our support circle is big, the length of each "
"line between a pair of points will never be long enough to see them. If this "
"happens, we simply would need to increase the number of points."

"Alright, we are now able to draw custom stuff on screen. However, it is "

"The reason is that your GPU is actually displaying the frames as fast as it "
"can. We need to \"normalize\" the drawing by this speed. To achieve, we have "
"to make use of the 'delta' parameter of the _process() function. 'delta' "
"contains the time elapsed between the two last rendered frames. It is "
