"This article is here to help you figure out whether Godot might be a good "
"fit for you. We will introduce some broad features of the engine to give you "
"a feel for what you can achieve with it and answer questions such as \"what "
"do I need to know to get started?\"."

msgid ""
"This is by no means an exhaustive overview. We will introduce many more "

msgid "What is Godot?"
msgstr "리지드 바디(rigid body)란?"

msgid ""
"Godot is a general-purpose 2D and 3D game engine designed to support all "
"sorts of projects. You can use it to create games or applications you can "
"then release on desktop or mobile, as well as on the web."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can also create console games with it, although you either need strong "
"programming skills or a developer to port the game for you."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Godot team can't provide an open-source console export due to the "
"licensing terms imposed by console manufacturers. Regardless of the engine "
"you use, though, releasing games on consoles is always a lot of work. You "
"can read more on that here: :ref:`doc_consoles`."
msgstr ""

msgid "What can the engine do?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot was initially developed in-house by an Argentinan game studio. Its "
"development started in 2001, and the engine was rewritten and improved "
"tremendously since its open-source release in 2014."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Some examples of games created with Godot include Ex-Zodiac and Helms of "
"Fury."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As for applications, the open-source pixel art drawing program Pixelorama is "
"powered by Godot, and so is the voxel RPG creator RPG in a box."
msgstr ""

msgid "You can find many more examples in the official showcase videos:"

"Godot comes with a fully-fledged game editor with integrated tools to answer "
"the most common needs. It includes a code editor, an animation editor, a "
"tilemap editor, a shader editor, a debugger, a profiler, and more."
msgstr ""
"Godot는 가장 일반적인 요구 사항을 위해 자체 툴을 제공하려고 합니다. 전용 스크"
"립팅 작업 공간, 애니메이션 편집기, 타일맵 편집기, 셰이더 편집기, 디버거, 프로"
"파일러, 로컬 및 원격 장치에서 핫 리로드 등의 기능이 있습니다."

msgid ""
"The team strives to offer a feature-rich game editor with a consistent user "
"experience. While there is always room for improvement, the user interface "
"keeps getting refined."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Of course, if you prefer, you can work with external programs. We officially "
"support importing 3D scenes designed in Blender_ and maintain plugins to "
"code in VSCode_ and Emacs_ for GDScript and C#. We also support Visual "
"Studio for C# on Windows."

msgid "Programming languages"
msgstr "디자인 언어"

msgid "Let's talk about the available programming languages."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can code your games using :ref:`GDScript <toc-learn-scripting-"
"gdscript>`, a Godot-specific and tightly integrated language with a "
"lightweight syntax, or :ref:`C# <toc-learn-scripting-C#>`, which is popular "
"in the games industry. These are the two main scripting languages we support."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"Godot also supports a node-based visual programming language named :ref:"
"`VisualScript <toc-learn-scripting-visual_script>`."
msgstr ":ref:`VisualScript: <toc-learn-scripting-visual_script>`"

msgid ""
"With the :ref:`GDNative <toc-tutorials-gdnative>` technology, you can also "
"write gameplay or high-performance algorithms in C or C++ without "
"recompiling the engine. You can use this technology to integrate third-party "
"libraries and other Software Development Kits (SDK) in the engine."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Of course, you can also directly add modules and features to the engine, as "
"it's completely free and open-source."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"These are the five officially supported programming languages. The community "
"maintains support for many more. For more information, see :ref:`GDNative "
"third-party bindings <doc_what_is_gdnative_third_party_bindings>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "What do I need to know to use Godot?"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot is a feature-packed game engine. With its thousands of features, there "
"is a lot to learn. To make the most of it, you need good programming "
"foundations. While we try to make the engine accessible, you will benefit a "
"lot from knowing how to think like a programmer first."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Godot relies on the object-oriented programming paradigm. Being comfortable "
"with concepts such as classes and objects will help you code efficiently in "
"it."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you are entirely new to programming, we recommend following the `CS50 "
"open courseware`_ from Harvard University. It's a great free course that "
"will teach you everything you need to know to be off to a good start. It "
"will save you countless hours and hurdles learning any game engine afterward."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In CS50, you will learn multiple programming languages. Don't be afraid of "
"that: programming languages have many similarities. The skills you learn "
"with one language transfer well to others."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We will provide you with more Godot-specific learning resources in :ref:"
"`doc_learning_new_features`."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In the next part, you will get an overview of the engine's essential "
"concepts."
