msgid "Nodes and Scenes"
msgstr "노드와 씬"

"In :ref:`doc_key_concepts_overview`, we saw that a Godot game is a tree of "
"scenes and that each scene is a tree of nodes. In this lesson, we explain a "
"bit more about them. You will also create your first scene."
msgstr ""

msgid "Nodes"
msgstr "노드"

msgid ""
"**Nodes are the fundamental building blocks of your game**. They are like "
"the ingredients in a recipe. There are dozens of kinds that can display an "
"image, play a sound, represent a camera, and much more."
msgstr ""

msgid "All nodes have the following attributes:"
msgstr "다음과 같은 주의 사항이 있습니다:"

#, fuzzy
msgid "A name."
msgstr "작업 이름"

#, fuzzy
msgid "Editable properties."
msgstr "편집할 수 있는 속성이 있습니다."

#, fuzzy
msgid "They receive callbacks to update every frame."
msgstr "각 프레임을 처리하기 위한 콜백을 받을 수 있습니다."

#, fuzzy
msgid "You can extend them with new properties and functions."
msgstr "(더 많은 기능을 포함하기 위해) 확장될 수 있습니다."

#, fuzzy
msgid "You can add them to another node as a child."
msgstr "다른 노드의 자식으로 추가될 수 있습니다."

msgid ""
"The last attribute is key. **Together, nodes form a tree**, which is a "
"powerful feature to organize projects. Since different nodes have different "
"functions, combining them produces more complex behavior. As we saw before, "
"you can build a playable character the camera follows using a kinematic body "
"node named \"Character\", a sprite node, a camera node, and a collision "
"shape node."
msgstr ""

msgid "Scenes"
msgstr "씬(Scene)"

msgid ""
"When you organize nodes in a tree, like our character, we call this "
"construct a scene. Once saved, scenes work like new node types in the "
"editor, where you can add them as a child of an existing node. In that case, "
"the instance of the scene appears as a single node with its internals hidden."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Scenes allow you to structure your game's code however you want. You can "
"**compose nodes** to create custom and complex node types, like a game "
"character that runs and jumps, a life bar, a chest with which you can "
"interact, and more."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Godot editor essentially is a **scene editor**. It has plenty of tools "
"for editing 2D and 3D scenes, as well as user interfaces. A Godot project "
"can contain as many of these scenes as you need. The engine only requires "
"one as your application's **main scene**. This is the scene Godot will first "
"load when you or a player runs the game."
msgstr ""
"기본적으로 Godot 에디터는 **씬 에디터**\\ 입니다. 유저 인터페이스 말고도 2D"
"와 3D 씬을 편집하기 위한 툴이 많이 있지만, 에디터는 씬과 씬을 구성하는 노드들"
"을 편집하는 개념을 기반으로 합니다."

msgid "On top of acting like nodes, scenes have the following attributes:"
msgstr ""

msgid "They always have one root node, like the \"Character\" in our example."
msgstr ""

msgid "You can save them to your hard drive and load them later."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can create as many instances of a scene as you'd like. You could have "
"five or ten characters in your game, created from your Character scene."

msgid "Creating your first scene"
msgstr "프로젝트 생성하기"

msgid ""
"Let's create our first scene with a single node. To do so, you will need to "
"create a new project first. After opening the project, you should see an "
"empty editor."
msgstr ""

"In an empty scene, the Scene dock on the left shows several options to add a "
"root node quickly. \"2D Scene\" adds a Node2D node, \"3D Scene\" adds a "
"Spatial node, and \"User Interface\" adds a Control node. These presets are "
"here for convenience; they are not mandatory. \"Other Node\" lets you select "
"any node to be the root node. In an empty scene, \"Other Node\" is "
"equivalent to pressing the \"Add Child Node\" button at the top-left of the "
"Scene dock, which usually adds a new node as a child of the currently "
"selected node."

"(루트 노드가 없는) 비어있는 씬에서, 씬 독은 씬에 루트 노드를 빠르게 추가할 "
"수 있 여러 설정을 보여줍니다. \"2D 씬(2D Scene)\"은 Node2D 노드를, \"3D 씬"
"(3D Scene)\"은 Spatial 노드를, \"유저 인터페이스(User Interface)\"는 Control "
