"Other engines might encourage the use of creating \"manager\" classes that "

"thrives by supporting ways to cut down the size of such objects. Instead it "

"Users tend to think the best solution is to make the whole system smarter by "
"making a SoundManager autoload node. It generates a pool of "
"AudioStreamPlayers that cycle through as each new request for sound effects "
"comes in. They then make this SoundManager an autoload so that they can "
"access it from anywhere with `SFX.play(\"coin_pickup.ogg\")`. Little do they "

"**Static Data**: if you need static data, i.e. data that should be "

"Godot's scripting API, so autoload singletons are the next best thing. If "

"**Convenience**: autoloaded nodes have a global variable for their name "
"generated in GDScript. This can be very convenient for defining objects that "
"should always exist, but which need object instance information. The "
"alternative is to create a namespace script: a script that's purpose is only "
"to load and create constants to access other Script or PackedScene "
"resources, resulting in something like ``MyAutoload.MyNode.new()``."

"Note that the introduction of script classes in Godot 3.1 questions the "

"If the singleton is managing its own information and not invading the data "

"or dialogue system would be great use cases of singleton implementations."
