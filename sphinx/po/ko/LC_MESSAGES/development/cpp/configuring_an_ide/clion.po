"`CLion <https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/>`_ is a commercial IDE for C++. It "
"requires a ``CMakeLists.txt`` file as a project file, which is problematic "
"for Godot which uses the SCons buildsystem instead of CMake. However, there "
"is a ``CMakeLists.txt`` configuration for :ref:`Android Studio "
"<doc_configuring_an_ide_android_studio>` which can also be used by CLion."
