msgid "Introduction"
msgstr "소개"

msgid ""
"**GDNative** is a Godot-specific technology that lets the engine interact "
"with native `shared libraries <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"
"Library_(computing)#Shared_libraries>`__ at run-time. You can use it to run "
"native code without compiling it with the engine."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"GDNative is *not* a scripting language and has no relation to :ref:`GDScript "
"<doc_gdscript>`."

msgid "Differences between GDNative and C++ modules"
msgstr "C#과 GDScript와의 일반적인 차이"

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"You can use both GDNative and :ref:`C++ modules <doc_custom_modules_in_c++>` "
"to run C or C++ code in a Godot project."
msgstr ""
"엔진 바이너리와 정적으로 연결된 :ref:`C++ 모듈 <doc_custom_modules_in_c++>` "
"지원."

msgid ""
"They also both allow you to integrate third-party libraries into Godot. The "
"one you should choose depends on your needs."

msgid "Advantages of GDNative"
msgstr "**이점:**"

msgid ""
"Unlike modules, GDNative doesn't require compiling the engine's source code, "
"making it easier to distribute your work. It gives you access to most of the "
"API available to GDScript C#, allowing you to code game logic with full "
"control regarding performance. It's ideal if you need high-performance code "
"you'd like to distribute as an add-on in the :ref:`asset library "
"<doc_what_is_assetlib>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Also:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"GDNative is not limited to C and C++. Thanks to :ref:`third-party bindings "
"<doc_what_is_gdnative_third_party_bindings>`, you can use it with many other "
"languages."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can use the same compiled GDNative library in the editor and exported "
"project. With C++ modules, you have to recompile all the export templates "
"you plan to use if you require its functionality at run-time."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"GDNative only requires you to compile your library, not the whole engine. "
"That's unlike C++ modules, which are statically compiled into the engine. "
"Every time you change a module, you need to recompile the engine. Even with "
"incremental builds, this process is slower than using GDNative."
msgstr ""

msgid "Advantages of C++ modules"
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"We recommend :ref:`C++ modules <doc_custom_modules_in_c++>` in cases where "
"GDNative isn't enough:"
msgstr ""
"엔진 바이너리와 정적으로 연결된 :ref:`C++ 모듈 <doc_custom_modules_in_c++>` "
"지원."

msgid ""
"C++ modules provide deeper integration into the engine. GDNative's access is "
"limited to what the scripting API exposes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can use C++ modules to provide additional features in a project without "
"carrying native library files around. This extends to exported projects."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"C++ modules are supported on all platforms. In contrast, GDNative isn't "
"supported on HTML5 and the Universal Windows Platform (UWP) yet."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"C++ modules can be faster than GDNative, especially when the code requires a "
"lot of communication through the scripting API."
