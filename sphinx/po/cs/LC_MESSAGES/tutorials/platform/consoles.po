"Regardless of the engine used to create the game, the process to publish a "
"game to a console platform is as follows:"

#: ../../docs/tutorials/platform/consoles.rst:12
msgid ""
"Register a developer account on the console manufacturer's website, then "
"sign NDAs and publishing contracts. This requires you to have a registered "
"legal entity."

msgid ""
"Gain access to the publishing platform by passing the acceptance process. "
"This can take up to several months. Note that this step is significantly "
"easier if an established publisher is backing your game. Nintendo is "
"generally known to be more accepting of smaller developers, but this is not "
"guaranteed."

"Get access to developer tools and order a console specially made for "
"developers (*devkit*). The cost of those devkits is confidential."

"To be published, your game needs to be rated in the regions you'd like to "
"sell it in. For example, in North America, the `ESRB <https://www.esrb.org/"
">`__ handles game ratings. In Europe, this is done by `PEGI <https://pegi."
"info/>`__. Indie developers can generally get a rating for cheaper compared "
"to more established developers."

"Due to the complexity of the process, the budget to publish a game by "

"To develop for consoles, one must be licensed as a company. As an open "

"Console SDKs are secret and covered by non-disclosure agreements. Even if we "

"under an open source license."

"In practice, the process is quite similar to Unity and Unreal Engine, except "
"that you need to contact a third-party developer to handle the porting "
"process. In other words, there is no engine that is legally allowed to "
"distribute console export templates without requiring the user to prove that "
"they are a licensed console developer. Doing so would violate the console "
"manufacturer's NDA."
