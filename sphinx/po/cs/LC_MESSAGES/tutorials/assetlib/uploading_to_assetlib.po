"The asset must have a proper **.gitignore** file. It's important to keep "

"The **license** needs to be correct. The license listed on the asset library "
"must match the license in the repository. The repo MUST have a license file, "

"If you are submitting a plugin, add a **copy** of your license and readme to "
