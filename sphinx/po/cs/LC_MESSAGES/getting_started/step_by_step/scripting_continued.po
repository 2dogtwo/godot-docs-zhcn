"Several actions in Godot are triggered by callbacks or virtual functions, so "
"there is no need to write code that runs all the time."

msgid ""
"However, it is still common to need a script to be processed on every frame. "
"There are two types of processing: idle processing and physics processing."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/step_by_step/scripting_continued.rst:16
msgid ""
"Idle processing is activated when the method :ref:`Node._process() "
"<class_Node__process>` is found in a script. It can be turned off and on "
"with the :ref:`Node.set_process() <class_Node_set_process>` function."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/step_by_step/scripting_continued.rst:20
msgid ""
"This method will be called every time a frame is drawn, so it's fully "
"dependent on how many frames per second (FPS) the application is running at:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/step_by_step/scripting_continued.rst:37
msgid ""
"The delta parameter contains the time elapsed in seconds, as a floating "
"point, since the previous call to ``_process()``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/step_by_step/scripting_continued.rst:40
msgid ""
"This parameter can be used to make sure things always take the same amount "
"of time, regardless of the game's FPS."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/step_by_step/scripting_continued.rst:43
msgid ""
"For example, movement is often multiplied with a time delta to make movement "
"speed both constant and independent from the frame rate."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/step_by_step/scripting_continued.rst:46
msgid ""
"Physics processing with ``_physics_process()`` is similar, but it should be "
"used for processes that must happen before each physics step, such as "
"controlling a character. It always runs before a physics step and it is "
"called at fixed time intervals: 60 times per second by default. You can "
"change the interval from the Project Settings, under Physics -> Common -> "
"Physics Fps."
msgstr ""

"The function ``_process()``, however, is not synced with physics. Its frame "
"rate is not constant and is dependent on hardware and game optimization. Its "
"execution is done after the physics step on single-threaded games."

"A simple way to test this is to create a scene with a single Label node, "
"with the following script:"
msgstr ""

"Nodes can be added to groups, as many as desired per node, and is a useful "
"feature for organizing large scenes. There are two ways to do this. The "
"first is from the UI, from the Groups button under the Node panel:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/step_by_step/scripting_continued.rst:92
msgid ""
"And the second way is from code. One example would be to tag scenes which "
"are enemies:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/step_by_step/scripting_continued.rst:110
msgid ""
"This way, if the player is discovered sneaking into a secret base, all "
"enemies can be notified about its alarm sounding by using :ref:`SceneTree."
"call_group() <class_SceneTree_call_group>`:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/step_by_step/scripting_continued.rst:127
msgid ""
"The above code calls the function ``player_was_discovered`` on every member "
"of the group ``enemies``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/step_by_step/scripting_continued.rst:130
msgid ""
"It is also possible to get the full list of ``enemies`` nodes by calling :"
"ref:`SceneTree.get_nodes_in_group() <class_SceneTree_get_nodes_in_group>`:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/step_by_step/scripting_continued.rst:143
msgid ""
"The :ref:`SceneTree <class_SceneTree>` class provides many useful methods, "
"like interacting with scenes, their node hierarchy and groups of nodes. It "
"allows you to easily switch scenes or reload them, to quit the game or pause "
"and unpause it. It even comes with interesting signals. So check it out if "
"you got some time!"

msgid "Notifications"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/step_by_step/scripting_continued.rst:153
msgid ""
"Godot has a system of notifications. These are usually not needed for "
"scripting, as it's too low-level and virtual functions are provided for most "
"of them. It's just good to know they exist. For example, you may add an :ref:"
"`Object._notification() <class_Object__notification>` function in your "
"script:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/step_by_step/scripting_continued.rst:188
msgid ""
"The documentation of each class in the :ref:`Class Reference <toc-class-"
"ref>` shows the notifications it can receive. However, in most cases "
"GDScript provides simpler overrideable functions."

msgid ""
"To delete a node, be it inside or outside the scene, ``free()`` must be used:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/step_by_step/scripting_continued.rst:313
msgid ""
"When a node is freed, it also frees all its children nodes. Because of this, "
"manually deleting nodes is much simpler than it appears. Free the base node "
"and everything else in the subtree goes away with it."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/step_by_step/scripting_continued.rst:317
msgid ""
"A situation might occur where we want to delete a node that is currently "
"\"blocked\", because it is emitting a signal or calling a function. This "
"will crash the game. Running Godot with the debugger will often catch this "
"case and warn you about it."
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/step_by_step/scripting_continued.rst:322
msgid ""
"The safest way to delete a node is by using :ref:`Node.queue_free() "
"<class_Node_queue_free>`. This erases the node safely during idle."

"Instancing a scene from code is done in two steps. The first one is to load "

msgid "Preloading it can be more convenient, as it happens at parse time:"

"But ``scene`` is not yet a node. It's packed in a special resource called :"
"ref:`PackedScene <class_PackedScene>`. To create the actual node, the "
"function :ref:`PackedScene.instance() <class_PackedScene_instance>` must be "
"called. This will return the tree of nodes that can be added to the active "
"scene:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../docs/getting_started/step_by_step/scripting_continued.rst:380
msgid ""
"The advantage of this two-step process is that a packed scene may be kept "
"loaded and ready to use so that you can create as many instances as desired. "
"This is especially useful to quickly instance several enemies, bullets, and "
"other entities in the active scene."
