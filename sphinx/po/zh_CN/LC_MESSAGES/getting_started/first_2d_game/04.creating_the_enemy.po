"Now it's time to make the enemies our player will have to dodge. Their "
"behavior will not be very complex: mobs will spawn randomly at the edges of "
"the screen, choose a random direction, and move in a straight line."
msgstr ""
"是时候去做一些玩家必须躲避的敌人了. 它们的行为很简单: 怪物将随机生成在屏幕的"
"边缘, 沿着随机的方向直线移动."

msgid ""
"We'll create a ``Mob`` scene, which we can then *instance* to create any "
"number of independent mobs in the game."
msgstr ""
"我们将创建一个 ``Mob`` 的怪物场景, 以便在游戏中独立 *实例化* 出任意数量的怪"

msgstr "别忘了设置子项, 使其无法被选中, 就像你对 ``Player`` 场景所做的那样."

msgid ""
"In the :ref:`RigidBody2D <class_RigidBody2D>` properties, set ``Gravity "
"Scale`` to ``0``, so the mob will not fall downward. In addition, under the "
"``PhysicsBody2D`` section, click the ``Mask`` property and uncheck the first "
"box. This will ensure the mobs do not collide with each other."
msgstr ""
"在 :ref:`RigidBody2D <class_RigidBody2D>` 属性中, 将 ``Gravity Scale`` 设置"
"为 ``0``, 这样怪物就不会下坠. 此外, 在 ``PhysicsBody2D`` 部分下, 点击 "
"``Mask`` 属性并去除第一个复选框的勾选. 这会确保怪物不会彼此碰撞."

msgid ""
"Set up the :ref:`AnimatedSprite <class_AnimatedSprite>` like you did for the "
"player. This time, we have 3 animations: ``fly``, ``swim``, and ``walk``. "
"There are two images for each animation in the art folder."

"像设置玩家一样设置 :ref:`AnimatedSprite <class_AnimatedSprite>`\\ 。这一次，"

"property to ``90`` (under \"Transform\" in the Inspector)."
msgstr ""
"像在 ``Player`` 场景中一样, 为碰撞添加一个 ``CapsuleShape2D`` . 为了使形状与"

msgstr ""
"首先, 我们从AnimatedSprite的 ``frames`` 读取所有动画的名称列表. 这个属性会返"

msgid ""
"We then need to pick a random number between ``0`` and ``2`` to select one "

"selects a random integer between ``0`` and ``n-1``."
msgstr ""
"然后我们需要在 ``0`` 和 ``2`` 之间选取一个随机的数字, 以在列表中选择一个名称"
"(数组索引以 ``0`` 起始). ``randi() % n`` 会在 ``0`` and ``n-1`` 之中选择一个"

msgid ""
"You must use ``randomize()`` if you want your sequence of \"random\" numbers "
