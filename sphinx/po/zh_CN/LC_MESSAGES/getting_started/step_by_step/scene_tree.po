"In previous tutorials, everything revolved around the concept of nodes. "
"Scenes are simply a collection of nodes. They become active once they enter "
"the *scene tree*."
msgstr ""
"在前面的教程中, 一切都围绕节点的概念展开。场景只是节点的集合。一旦进入 *场景"

"This concept deserves going into a little more detail. In fact, the scene "
"system is not even a core component of Godot as it is possible to skip it "
"and write a script (or C++ code) that talks directly to the servers, but "
"making a game that way would be a lot of work."
msgstr ""
"这个概念值得更详细一些。事实上, 场景系统甚至不是 godot 的核心组件, 因为可以跳"
"过它, 编写一个直接与服务器对话的脚本 (或 c++ 代码), 但以这种方式制作游戏将是"

"The way Godot works internally is as follows. There is the :ref:`OS "
"<class_OS>` class, which is the only instance that runs at the beginning. "
"Afterwards, all drivers, servers, scripting languages, scene system, etc are "
"loaded."
msgstr ""
"godot 内部的工作方式如下所示。有:ref:`OS <class_OS>`类, 它是在开始时运行的唯"

msgid ""
"When initialization is complete, :ref:`OS <class_OS>` needs to be supplied "
"a :ref:`MainLoop <class_MainLoop>` to run. Up to this point, all this is "
"internals working (you can check main/main.cpp file in the source code if "
"you are ever interested to see how this works internally)."
msgstr ""
"初始化完成后, 需要向:ref:`OS <class_OS>`提供一个:ref:`MainLoop "
"<class_MainLoop>`来运行。到目前为止, 所有这些都是内部工作 (您可以检查main/"
"main.cpp文件在源代码中, 如果你曾经有兴趣看到它是如何在内部工作)。"

"The user program, or game, starts in the MainLoop. This class has a few "
"methods, for initialization, idle (frame-synchronized callback), fixed "
"(physics-synchronized callback), and input. Again, this is low level and "
"when making games in Godot, writing your own MainLoop seldom makes sense."
msgstr ""
"用户程序或游戏从主循环开始。此类有几个方法, 用于初始化、空闲 (框架同步回调)、"
