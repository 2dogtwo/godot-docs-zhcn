"In :ref:`doc_key_concepts_overview`, we saw that a Godot game is a tree of "
"scenes and that each scene is a tree of nodes. In this lesson, we explain a "
"bit more about them. You will also create your first scene."

msgid "Nodes"
msgstr "节点"

msgid ""
"**Nodes are the fundamental building blocks of your game**. They are like "
"the ingredients in a recipe. There are dozens of kinds that can display an "
"image, play a sound, represent a camera, and much more."

msgid "All nodes have the following attributes:"
msgstr "有以下注意事项:"

msgid "A name."
msgstr "名称"

msgid "Editable properties."

msgid "You can extend them with new properties and functions."
msgstr "可以被扩展(以具有更多功能)."

msgid "You can add them to another node as a child."
msgstr "可以作为子节点被添加到其他节点上."

msgid ""
"The last attribute is key. **Together, nodes form a tree**, which is a "
"powerful feature to organize projects. Since different nodes have different "
"functions, combining them produces more complex behavior. As we saw before, "
"you can build a playable character the camera follows using a kinematic body "
"node named \"Character\", a sprite node, a camera node, and a collision "
"shape node."
msgstr ""

msgid "Scenes"
msgstr "场景"

msgid ""
"When you organize nodes in a tree, like our character, we call this "
"construct a scene. Once saved, scenes work like new node types in the "
"editor, where you can add them as a child of an existing node. In that case, "
"the instance of the scene appears as a single node with its internals hidden."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Scenes allow you to structure your game's code however you want. You can "
"**compose nodes** to create custom and complex node types, like a game "
"character that runs and jumps, a life bar, a chest with which you can "
"interact, and more."

msgid ""
"The Godot editor essentially is a **scene editor**. It has plenty of tools "
"for editing 2D and 3D scenes, as well as user interfaces. A Godot project "
"can contain as many of these scenes as you need. The engine only requires "
"one as your application's **main scene**. This is the scene Godot will first "
"load when you or a player runs the game."
msgstr ""
"本质上,Godot编辑器就是一个 **场景编辑器** . 它有很多用于编辑2D和3D场景以及用"
"户界面的工具, 但是编辑器是基于编辑场景及构成场景的节点的概念的."

msgid "On top of acting like nodes, scenes have the following attributes:"
msgstr ""

msgid "They always have one root node, like the \"Character\" in our example."
msgstr ""

msgid "You can save them to your hard drive and load them later."

"You can create as many instances of a scene as you'd like. You could have "
"five or ten characters in your game, created from your Character scene."

"Let's create our first scene with a single node. To do so, you will need to "
"create a new project first. After opening the project, you should see an "
"empty editor."

"In an empty scene, the Scene dock on the left shows several options to add a "
"root node quickly. \"2D Scene\" adds a Node2D node, \"3D Scene\" adds a "
"Spatial node, \"User Interface\" adds a Control node, and \"Other Node\" "
"lets you select any node. It is equivalent to pressing the \"Add Child Node"
"\" button. These presets are here for convenience; they are not mandatory."

"Press the \"Add Child Node\" button at the top left of the Scene dock to "
"create a node. This button adds the chosen node as a child of the currently "
"selected one or, in an empty scene, as the root."

"为此, 我们需要添加 Label(标签)节点. 点击场景面板左上角的 \"添加子节点\" 按钮"
"(加号图标). 这是往场景中添加新节点的主要方式, 会把新建的节点加到当前所选节点"

"A lot happens when you add a scene's first node. The scene changes to the 2D "
"workspace because Label is a 2D node type. The Label appears, selected, in "
