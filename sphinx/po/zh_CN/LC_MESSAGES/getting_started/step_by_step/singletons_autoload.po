"Godot's scene system, while powerful and flexible, has a drawback: there is "
"no method for storing information (e.g. a player's score or inventory) that "
"is needed by more than one scene."

"You can use a \"master\" scene that loads and unloads other scenes as its "

"You can use AutoLoad to load a scene or a script that inherits from :ref:"

"This tutorial will demonstrate building a scene switcher using autoload. For "

"details). However, if you need more complex behavior when changing scenes, "
"this method provides more functionality."

"The project contains two scenes: ``Scene1.tscn`` and ``Scene2.tscn``. Each "

"Returning to the script, it needs to fetch the current scene in the "

"As mentioned in the comments above, we need to avoid the situation of "
"deleting the current scene while it is still being used (i.e. its code is "
"still running), so using :ref:`Object.call_deferred() "
"<class_Object_call_deferred>` is required at this point. The result is that "
"the second function will run at a later time when any code from the current "
