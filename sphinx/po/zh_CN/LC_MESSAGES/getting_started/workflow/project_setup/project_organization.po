"Since Godot has no restrictions on project structure or filesystem usage, "
"organizing files when learning the engine can seem challenging. This "
"tutorial suggests a workflow which should be a good starting point. We will "
"also cover using version control with Godot."

"Godot is scene-based in nature, and uses the filesystem as-is, without "

"Unlike other engines, many resources are contained within the scene itself, "
"so the amount of files in the filesystem is considerably lower."

"与其他引擎不同，场景本身包含许多资源，因此文件系统中的文件数量要少得多。"

"Considering that, the most common approach is to group assets as close to "

"As an example, one can usually place into a single folder their basic "
