"Godot offers a more elegant approach for PC distribution when using the "
"export system. When exporting for PC (Linux, Windows, macOS), the exporter "
"takes all the project files and creates a ``data.pck`` file. This file is "
"bundled with a specially optimized binary that is smaller, faster and does "
"not contain the editor and debugger."

"Godot在使用导出系统时，为PC分发提供了一种更为优雅的方法。 当为PC（Linux、"
"Windows、macOS）导出时，导出器将提取所有项目文件，并创建一个 ``data.pck`` 文"
"件。该文件与特别优化的二进制文件捆绑在一起，更小、更快、并且不包含编辑器和调"
"试器。"
