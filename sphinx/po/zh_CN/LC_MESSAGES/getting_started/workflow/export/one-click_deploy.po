"One-click deploy is a feature that is available once a platform is properly "
"configured and a supported device is connected to the computer. Since things "
"can go wrong at many levels (platform may not be configured correctly, SDK "
"may be incorrectly installed, device may be improperly configured, etc.), "
"it's good to let the user know that it exists."
msgstr ""
"一旦平台配置正确, 且支持的设备连接到电脑上, 这个功能就会自动弹出. 由于事情可"
"能会在很多层面上出错(平台可能没有正确配置,SDK可能安装错误, 设备可能配置不当"
"等), 所以让用户知道它的存在是件好事."

"After adding an Android export preset marked as Runnable, Godot can detect "
"when a USB device is connected to the computer and offer the user to "
"automatically export, install and run the project (in debug mode) on the "
"device. This feature is called *one-click deploy*."

"一些平台(写这篇文章的时候, 只有Android)可以检测到USB设备连接到电脑上, 并为用"
"户提供在设备上自动导出, 安装和运行项目(在调试模式下). 这个功能用业界的流行语"

"One-click deploy is only available once you've added an export template "
"marked as **Runnable** in the Export dialog. You can mark several export "
"presets as runnable, but only one preset per platform may be marked as "
"runnable. If you mark a second preset in a given platform as runnable, the "
"other preset will no longer be marked as runnable."
