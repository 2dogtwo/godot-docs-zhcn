"This tutorial series aims to illustrate intended Godot workflows, i.e. the "
"\"best practices\" of defining one's game API. Godot allows for a great "
"amount of flexibility in how one designs a project's code and scene "
"structure. Each method will have its own advantages and disadvantages, so "
"outlining the best practices should help users feel less confused as they "
"further explore Godot's depth."

"本教程系列旨在讲解Godot预期的工作流程，换言之，就是定义一个游戏API的“最佳实"
"践”。Godot允许我们设计项目代码和场景结构时注入大量的灵活性。每个方法都有其自"
"身的优势和缺点，因此概述最佳实践有助于用户在未来探索Godot的道路上消解困惑。"

"This series is also designed to help get users thinking about the best way "
"to reason about best practices. It would be impossible to give a "
"comprehensive overview of what one should do for any arbitrary design "
"decision. As such, each article breaks problems down into the fundamental "
"questions they pose, suggests the available solutions, analyzes the "
"advantages and disadvantages of each option, and then highlights the best "
"course of action depending on the circumstances."

"本系列也意在帮助用户考虑如何以最好的方式去解读这种实践。我们无法给出一个人在"

"身提出的多个基本问题，并建议其可行的解决方案，分析各种选择的利弊，并之后依实"

"While the articles in this series are largely topic-directed, it is "
"recommended that users begin with the :ref:`doc_what_are_godot_classes` "
"article. It is from there that the \"best practices\" for the rest of the "
"engine become more clear, based on established OOP practices."
