"**Donate.** Godot is a non-profit project, but it can still benefit from "
"user donations for many things. Apart from usual expenses such as hosting "
"costs or promotion material on events, we also use donation money to acquire "
"hardware when necessary (e.g. we used donation money to buy a Macbook Pro to "
"implement Retina/HiDPI support and various other macOS-related features). "
"Most importantly, we also used donation money to hire core developers so "
"they can work full-time on the engine. Even with a low monthly wage, we need "
"a steady donation income to continue doing this, which has been very "
"beneficial to the project so far. So if you want to donate some money to the "
