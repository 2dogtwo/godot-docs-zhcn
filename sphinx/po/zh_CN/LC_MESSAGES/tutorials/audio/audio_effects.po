msgid "Audio effects"
msgstr "添加特效"

msgid ""
"Godot includes several audio effects that can be added to an audio bus to "
"alter every sound file that goes through that bus."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Try them all out to get a sense of how they alter sound. Here follows a "
"short description of the available effects:"
msgstr "全部试一试, 感受声音的改变. 下面是对以上效果的简短描述:"

msgid "Amplify"
msgstr "增幅(Amplify)"

msgid ""
"Amplify changes the amplitude of the signal. Some care needs to be taken. "
"Setting the level too high can make the sound clip, which is usually "
"undesirable."
msgstr ""
"增幅改变信号的振幅. 使用时要小心. 把电平调得太高的话, 声音就会被削波, 这通常"
"是不可取的."

msgid "BandLimit and BandPass"
msgstr "带限和带通(BandLimit and BandPass)"

msgid ""
"These are resonant filters which block frequencies around the *Cutoff* "
"point. BandPass can be used to simulate sound passing through an old "
"telephone line or megaphone. Modulating the BandPass frequency can simulate "
"the sound of a wah-wah guitar pedal, think of the guitar in Jimi Hendrix's "
"*Voodoo Child (Slight Return)*."
msgstr ""
"它们是共振滤波器, 在 *截断* (Cutoff)点附近阻断频率. 带通滤波器可以用来模拟旧"
"电话线路或扩音器传出的声音. 调节带通滤波器的频率, 可以模拟吉他哇音(wah-wah)踏"
"板的声音, 想想吉米·亨德里克斯在 *Voodoo Child (Slight Return)* 中使用的吉他"
"吧."

msgid "Capture"
msgstr "Capture（捕获）"

msgid ""
"The Capture effect copies the audio frames of the audio bus that it is on "
"into an internal buffer. This can be used to capture data from the "
"microphone or to transmit audio over the network in real-time."
msgstr ""
"Capture（采集）效果器会将其所在音频总线的音频帧复制到内部缓冲区中。可用于从麦"
"克风获取音频或通过网络实时传输音频。"

msgid "Chorus"
msgstr "和声(Chorus)"

msgid ""
"The Chorus effect duplicates the incoming audio, delays the duplicate "
"slightly and uses an LFO to continuously modulate the pitch of the "
"duplicated signal before mixing the duplicated signal(s) and the original "
"together again. This creates a shimmering effect and adds stereo width to "
"the sound."
msgstr ""
"和声效果器会复制传入的音频, 稍微延迟重复信号, 并使用低频振荡器连续调节重复信"
"号的音高, 然后再将重复信号(一个或多个)和原始信号混合在一起. 这就产生了一种微"
"光效果, 并增加了声音的立体声宽度."

msgid "Compressor"
msgstr "压缩(Compressor)"

msgid ""
"A dynamic range compressor automatically attenuates the level of the "
"incoming signal when its amplitude exceeds a certain threshold. The level of "
"attenuation applied is proportional to how far the incoming audio exceeds "
"the threshold. The compressor's Ratio parameter controls the degree of "
"attenuation. One of the main uses of a compressor is to reduce the dynamic "
"range of signals with very loud and quiet parts. Reducing the dynamic range "
"of a signal can make it easier to mix."
msgstr ""
"当输入信号的幅度超过某一阈值时, 动态范围压缩器会自动衰减该信号的电平. 衰减的"
"程度与传入的音频超过阈值的程度成正比. 压缩器的 \"比例\" 参数控制衰减的系数. "
"压缩器的主要用途之一是, 一个信号具有非常大声和小声的部分时, 压缩器可以用于降"
"低动态范围. 降低信号的动态范围会更方便混音."

msgid "The compressor has many uses. For example:"
msgstr "压缩器有很多用途. 例如:"

msgid "It can be used in the Master bus to compress the whole output."
msgstr "它可以在主总线中用于压缩整体输出."

msgid ""
"It can be used in voice channels to ensure they sound as even as possible."
msgstr "它可以在人声通道中使用, 使它们听起来尽可能均匀."

msgid ""
"It can be *sidechained*. This means it can reduce the sound level of one "
"signal using the level of another audio bus for threshold detection. This "
"technique is very common in video game mixing to \"duck\" the level of music "
"or sound effects when voices need to be heard."
msgstr ""
"它可以是 *Sidechained* . 也就是说, 它可以利用另一个音频总线的电平来降低一个信"
"号的电平, 进行阈值检测. 这种技术在电子游戏混音中非常常见. 在出现语音时, 音乐"
"或音效的电平会被 \"降低\"."

msgid ""
"It can accentuate transients by using a slower attack. This can make sound "
"effects more punchy."
msgstr "它可以通过较慢的启动(attack)来强调瞬态. 让音效听起来更有力."

msgid ""
"If your goal is to prevent a signal from exceeding a given amplitude "
"altogether, rather than to reduce the dynamic range of the signal, a :ref:"
"`limiter <doc_audio_buses_limiter>` is likely a better choice than a "
"compressor."
msgstr ""
"如果你的目标是防止信号总体超过某个振幅限制, 而不是减少信号的动态范围……那么, :"
"ref:`限幅器 (limiter)<doc_audio_buses_limiter>` 可能是比压缩器更好的选择."

msgid "Delay"
msgstr "延迟(Delay)"

msgid ""
"Adds an \"echo\" effect with a feedback loop. It can be used together with "
"*Reverb* to simulate wide rooms, canyons, etc. where sound bounces are far "
"apart."
msgstr ""
"通过反馈回路添加 \"回音\" 效果. 它可以与 *混响* (Reverb)一起使用, 模拟宽阔的"
"房间, 峡谷等声音从远处反弹回来的地方."

msgid "Distortion"
msgstr "失真(Distortion)"

msgid ""
"Makes the sound distorted. Godot offers several types of distortion: "
"*overdrive*, *tan* and *bit crushing*. Distortion can be used to simulate "
"sound coming through a low-quality speaker or device."
msgstr ""
"使声音失真.Godot提供几种类型的失真: *overdrive* , *tan* 和 *bit crushing* . "
"失真可以用来模拟通过低质量扬声器或设备发出的声音."

msgid "EQ"
msgstr "均衡器(EQ)"

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"EQ is what all other equalizers inherit from. It can be extended with Custom "
"scripts to create an equalizer with a custom number of bands."
msgstr ""
"所有其他均衡器都从EQ继承而来. 它可以通过自定义脚本来扩展成一个具有自定义频段"
"数的均衡器."

msgid "EQ6, EQ10, EQ21"
msgstr "EQ6, EQ10, EQ21"

msgid ""
"Godot provides three equalizers with different numbers of bands. An "
"equalizer on the Master bus can be useful to cut frequencies that the "
"device's speakers can't reproduce well (e.g. a mobile phone's speakers won't "
"reproduce bass content well). The equalizer effect can be disabled when "
"headphones are plugged in."
msgstr ""
"Godot提供三个具有不同频带数的均衡器. 主总线上的均衡器可以有效地削减设备扬声器"
"不能很好地再现的频率(例如, 手机扬声器不能很好地再现低音部分). 插入耳机时可以"
"禁用均衡器效果."

msgid "Filter"

"directly."
msgstr "滤波器是所有其他处理器继承自的效果, 不能直接使用."

msgid "HighPassFilter"

msgid ""
"Cuts frequencies below a specific *Cutoff* frequency. HighPassFilter is used "

"这些滤波器削减低于特定 *截断* 频率的频率. 高通滤波器用于降低信号的低音含量."

msgid "HighShelfFilter"
msgstr "高架滤波器(HighShelfFilter)"

msgid "Reduces all frequencies above a specific *Cutoff* frequency."
msgstr "减少所有高于特定 *截断* 值的频率."

msgid "Limiter"
msgstr "限幅器(Limiter)"

msgid ""
"A limiter is similar to a compressor, but it's less flexible and designed to "
"prevent a signal's amplitude exceeding a given dB threshold. Adding a "
"limiter to the Master bus is a safeguard against clipping."
msgstr ""
"限幅器类似于压缩器, 但灵活性较差, 功能是限制声音不能超过给定的dB阈值. 在主总"
"线上添加一个限制器是防止削波的防护措施."

msgid "LowPassFilter"
msgstr "低通滤波器(LowPassFilter)"

msgid ""
"Cuts frequencies above a specific *Cutoff* frequency and can also resonate "
"(boost frequencies close to the *Cutoff* frequency). Low pass filters can be "
"used to simulate \"muffled\" sound. For instance, underwater sounds, sounds "
"blocked by walls, or distant sounds."
msgstr ""
"削减高于特定 *截断* 频率的频率, 也可以产生共振(加强接近 *截断* 频率的频率). "
"低通滤波器可以用来模拟 \"沉闷\" 的声音. 例如, 水下的声音, 墙后的声音或遥远的"
"声音."

msgid "LowShelfFilter"

msgid "Reduces all frequencies below a specific *Cutoff* frequency."
msgstr "削减所有低于特定 *截断* 值的频率."

msgid "NotchFilter"
msgstr "陷波滤波器(NotchFilter)"

msgid ""
"The opposite of the BandPassFilter, it removes a band of sound from the "
"frequency spectrum at a given *Cutoff* frequency."
msgstr "与带通滤波器相反, 它从频谱中的给定的 *截断* 处移除一个频段的声音."

msgid "Panner"
msgstr "声像(Panner)"

msgid ""
"The Panner allows the stereo balance of a signal to be adjusted between the "
"left and right channels (wear headphones to audition this effect)."
msgstr "声像效果允许在左右通道之间调整信号的立体声平衡(戴上耳机试听这个效果)."

msgid "Phaser"
msgstr "移相器(Phaser)"

msgid ""
"It probably does not make much sense to explain that this effect is formed "
"by two signals being dephased and cancelling each other out. You can make a "
"Darth Vader voice with it, or jet-like sounds."
msgstr ""
"这种效果是由两个信号移相后互相抵消产生的, 但光这么解释并不直观. 你可以用它制"
"作达斯 · 维德的声音, 或类似喷射的声音."

msgid "PitchShift"
msgstr "移调(PitchShift)"

msgid ""
"This effect allows the adjustment of the signal's pitch independently of its "
"speed. All frequencies can be increased/decreased with minimal effect on "
"transients. PitchShift can be useful to create unusually high or deep voices."
msgstr ""
"这种效果允许在不改变速度的前提下改变音调. 可以用对瞬态的影响最小的方式增/减所"

"can be tweaked to obtain the sound of a specific room. Reverb is commonly "
"outputted from :ref:`Area3Ds <class_Area3D>` (see :ref:`Reverb buses "
"<doc_audio_streams_reverb_buses>`), or to apply a \"chamber\" feel to all "
"sounds."
msgstr ""
"混响可以模拟不同大小的房间. 可以调整各种参数以获得特定房间的声效. 混响通常"
"从 :ref:`Areas <class_Area>` 输出(见 :ref:`Reverb buses "

msgid "SpectrumAnalyzer"
msgstr "频谱分析仪(SpectrumAnalyzer)"

msgid ""
"This effect doesn't alter audio, instead, you add this effect to buses you "
"want a spectrum analysis of. This would typically be used for audio "
"visualization. A demo project using this can be found `here <https://github."
"com/godotengine/godot-demo-projects/tree/master/audio/spectrum>`__."
