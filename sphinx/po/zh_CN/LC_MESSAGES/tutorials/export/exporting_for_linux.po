"Godot offers a more elegant approach for PC distribution when using the "
"export system. When exporting for Linux, the exporter takes all the project "
"files and creates a ``data.pck`` file. This file is bundled with a specially "
"optimized binary that is smaller, faster and does not contain the editor and "
"debugger."

"Godot在使用导出系统时, 为PC分发提供了一种更为优雅的方法. 当为PC(Linux, "
"Windows, macOS)导出时, 导出器将提取所有项目文件, 并创建一个 ``data.pck`` 文"
"件. 该文件与特别优化的二进制文件捆绑在一起, 更小, 更快, 并且不包含编辑器和调"
"试器."
