"In this tutorial, you'll learn how to use Godot's :ref:`InputEvent "
"<class_InputEvent>` system to capture player input. There are many different "
"types of input your game may use - keyboard, gamepad, mouse, etc. - and many "
"different ways to turn those inputs into actions in your game. This document "
"will show you some of the most common scenarios, which you can use as "
"starting points for your own projects."

"Sometimes you want your game to respond to a certain input event - pressing "
"the \"jump\" button, for example. For other situations, you might want "
"something to happen as long as a key is pressed, such as movement. In the "
"first case, you can use the ``_input()`` function, which will be called "
"whenever an input event occurs. In the second case, Godot provides the :ref:"
"`Input <class_Input>` singleton, which you can use to query the state of an "
"input."
