"Signals provide a way to decouple game objects, allowing you to avoid "
"forcing a fixed arrangement of nodes. One sign that a signal might be called "
"for is when you find yourself using ``get_parent()``. Referring directly to "
"a node's parent means that you can't easily move that node to another "
"location in the scene tree. This can be especially problematic when you are "
"instancing objects at runtime and may want to place them in an arbitrary "
"location in the running scene tree."

"Consider a player character that can rotate and shoot towards the mouse. "

"作为信号使用的另一个示例，让我们考虑一个可以旋转并向鼠标射击的游戏角色角色。"
"每次单击鼠标按钮，我们都会在游戏角色的位置创建子弹的实例。详情请参阅 :ref:"

"Instead, we need the bullets to be independent of the player's movement - "
"once fired, they should continue traveling in a straight line and the player "
"can no longer affect them. Instead of being added to the scene tree as a "
"child of the player, it makes more sense to add the bullet as a child of the "
"\"main\" game scene, which may be the player's parent or even further up the "
"tree."
msgstr ""
"相反，我们需要子弹独立于游戏角色的移动——一旦发射，子弹就会继续沿着直线运动，"
"游戏角色就不能再影响它们了。与其作为游戏角色的子节点被添加到场景树中，不如将"
"子弹作为“主”游戏场景的子节点添加上去更有意义，后者可能是游戏角色的父节点，甚"
"至可能是更高层级的树。"

"However, this will lead to a different problem. Now if you try to test your "
"\"Player\" scene independently, it will crash on shooting, because there is "
"no parent node to access. This makes it a lot harder to test your player "
"code independently and also means that if you decide to change your main "
"scene's node structure, the player's parent may no longer be the appropriate "
"node to receive the bullets."
msgstr ""
"然而，这将导致一个不同的问题。现在如果您尝试独立测试您的“游戏角色”场景，它会"
"在射击时崩溃，因为没有父节点可以访问。这使得独立测试游戏角色角色代码变得更加"
"困难，也意味着如果您决定改变主场景的节点结构，游戏角色的父节点可能不再是接收"
"子弹的合适节点。"

"The solution to this is to use a signal to \"emit\" the bullets from the "
"player. The player then has no need to \"know\" what happens to the bullets "
"after that - whatever node is connected to the signal can \"receive\" the "
"bullets and take the appropriate action to spawn them."
msgstr ""
"解决这个问题的方法是使用一个信号来“发射”游戏角色的子弹。游戏角色不需要“知"
"道”子弹在那之后发生了什么——任何连接到信号的节点都可以“接收”子弹并采取适当的行"
