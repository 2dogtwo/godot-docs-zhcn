"2D nodes, such as :ref:`Node2D <class_Node2D>`, or `Control "

"You can arrange canvas items in trees. Each item will inherit its parent's "
"transform: when the parent moves, its children move too."

"常规2D节点, 如 :ref:`Node2D <class_Node2D>` 或 :ref:`Control "
"<class_Control>` 都继承自 :ref:`CanvasItem <class_CanvasItem>` , 它是所有2D节"
"点的基础.CanvasItem 被组织成树状结构, 同时继承它们父节点的变换. 这意味着在移"

"A Viewport has the property :ref:`Viewport.canvas_transform "
"<class_Viewport_property_canvas_transform>`, allows to apply a custom :ref:"
"`Transform2D <class_Transform2D>` transform to the CanvasItem hierarchy it "
"contains. Nodes such as :ref:`Camera2D <class_Camera2D>` work by changing "
"that transform."

"To achieve effects like scrolling, manipulating the canvas transform "
"property is more efficient than moving the root canvas item and the entire "
"scene with it."
msgstr ""
"像滚动这样的效果最好是通过操纵画布transform变换属性来实现。这种方法比移动根画"
"布项(以及整个场景)更有效。"

"Usually though, we don't want *everything* in the game or app to be subject "
"to the canvas transform. For example:"

"通常情况下，我们并不希望游戏或应用程序中的 *所有东西* 都受到画布变换的约束。"

"**UI**: Think of a user interface (UI) or Heads-up display (HUD) "
"superimposed on our view of the game world. We want a life counter, score "
"display and other elements to retain their screen positions even when our "
"view of the game world changes."
msgstr ""
"**UI**: 想想看，用户界面（UI）或平视显示系统（HUD）叠加在我们游戏世界的视野。"

"**Transitions**: We may want visual effects used for transitions (fades, "
"blends) to remain at a fixed screen location."

"**Transitions(转场)** : 我们应该希望用于转场的效果(淡入淡出之类的东西)也保持"
"在固定的位置."

msgstr "如何在单个场景树中解决这些问题？"

msgid "CanvasLayers"
msgstr "CanvasLayer"

msgid ""
"The answer is :ref:`CanvasLayer <class_CanvasLayer>`, which is a node that "
"adds a separate 2D rendering layer for all its children and grand-children. "
"Viewport children will draw by default at layer \"0\", while a CanvasLayer "
"will draw at any numeric layer. Layers with a greater number will be drawn "
"above those with a smaller number. CanvasLayers also have their own "
"transform and do not depend on the transform of other layers. This allows "
"the UI to be fixed in screen-space while our view on the game world changes."
msgstr ""
"答案是 :ref:`CanvasLayer <class_CanvasLayer>` , 它是一个节点, 为所有子代和孙"
"代添加一个单独的2D渲染层.Viewport的子节点默认在图层 \"0 \" 处绘制, 而"
"CanvasLayer将在任何数字层处绘制. 数字较大的图层将绘制在数字较小的图层之上."
"CanvasLayers也有自己的变换, 不依赖于其他层的变换. 这使得当我们对游戏世界的观"
"察发生变化时,UI可以固定在屏幕空间中."

msgid ""
"An example of this is creating a parallax background. This can be done with "
"a CanvasLayer at layer \"-1\". The screen with the points, life counter and "
"pause button can also be created at layer \"1\"."
msgstr ""
"比如说创建Parallax Background(视差背景). 这可以通过层为 \"-1\" 的CanvasLayer"
"完成. 带有分数, 生命计数器和暂停按钮的屏幕也可以创建在编号为 \"1\" 的层中."

msgid "Here's a diagram of how it looks:"
msgstr "下面是它的图示:"

msgid ""
"CanvasLayers are independent of tree order, and they only depend on their "
"layer number, so they can be instantiated when needed."
msgstr ""
"CanvasLayer 独立于树顺序, 它们仅依赖于它们的层数, 因此可以只在需要时让它们实"
"例化."

msgid ""
"CanvasLayers aren't necessary to control the drawing order of nodes. The "
"standard way to ensuring that a node is  correctly drawn 'in front' or "
"'behind' others is to manipulate the order of the nodes in the scene panel. "
"Perhaps counterintuitively, the topmost nodes in the scene panel are drawn "
"on *behind* lower ones in the viewport. 2d nodes also have a property for "
"controlling their drawing order (see :ref:`Node2D.z_index "
"<class_Node2D_property_z_index>`)."
msgstr ""
"CanvasLayer 不需要控制节点的绘制顺序. 确保节点被正确绘制在 \"前面\" 或 \"后面"
"\" 的标准方法是操作场景面板中节点的顺序. 也许违反直觉, 场景面板中最上面的节点"
"绘制在视图端口中较低的节点 *后面* . 二维节点也有控制其绘图顺序的属性(参考 :"
"ref:`Node2D.z_index <class_Node2D_property_z_index>` )."
