"If a game was always going to be run on the same device and at the same "
"resolution, positioning controls would be a simple matter of setting the "
"position and size of each one of them. Unfortunately, that is rarely the "
"case."

"如果一个游戏总是用同一分辨率在同样的设备上运行, 摆放控件将是一个简单的事, 只"
"要逐个设置它们的位置属性和大小属性即可. 不幸的是, 能像这样处理的情况很少."

"Only TVs nowadays have a standard resolution and aspect ratio. Everything "

"There are several ways to handle this, but for now, let's just imagine that "
"the screen resolution has changed and the controls need to be re-positioned. "
"Some will need to follow the bottom of the screen, others the top of the "
"screen, or maybe the right or left margins."
msgstr ""
"有几种方法来处理这个问题, 但现在, 让我们想象一下, 屏幕分辨率已经改变, 控件需"
"要重新定位. 有的需要跟随屏幕的底部, 有的需要跟随屏幕的顶部, 也有的需要跟随左"
"右边距."

"This is done by editing the *margin* properties of controls. Each control "
"has four margins: left, right, bottom and top. By default, all of them "
"represent a distance in pixels relative to the top-left corner of the parent "
"control or (in case there is no parent control) the viewport."
msgstr ""
"这是通过编辑控件的 *margin* 属性来实现的. 每个控件都有四个边距: 左, 右, 底和"
"顶. 默认情况下, 它们都表示相对于父控件的左上角或在没有父控件的情况下视窗的像"
"素距离."

"When horizontal (left, right) and/or vertical (top, bottom) anchors are "
"changed to 1, the margin values become relative to the bottom-right corner "
"of the parent control or viewport."
msgstr ""
"当水平(左, 右)和/或 垂直(上, 下)锚点被改为1时, 边距值就会变成相对于父控件或视"
"窗的右下角."

"Here, the control is set to expand its bottom-right corner with that of the "
"parent, so when re-sizing the parent, the control will always cover it, "
"leaving a 20 pixel margin:"

"在这里, 控件被设置为与父级的右下角一起展开, 所以当调整父级的大小时, 控件将始"

"To center a control in its parent, set its anchors to 0.5 and each margin to "
"half of its relevant dimension. For example, the code below shows how a "
"TextureRect can be centered in its parent:"

"要将控件集中到其父控件中, 其锚定值为0.5, 每个边距为其相关尺寸的一半. 例如, 下"

msgid ""
"Setting each anchor to 0.5 moves the reference point for the margins to the "
"center of its parent. From there, we set negative margins so that the "
"control gets its natural size."
msgstr ""
"将每个锚定值设置为0.5, 将边缘的参考点移动到父锚点的中心. 在此基础上, 我们设置"
"了负边距, 以便控件获得其自然大小."
