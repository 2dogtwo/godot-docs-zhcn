"Traditionally, `cutout animation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"
"Cutout_animation>`__ is a type of `stop motion animation <https://en."
"wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_motion>`__ in which pieces of paper (or other thin "
"material) are cut into special shapes and arranged in two-dimensional "
"representations of characters and objects. Characters' bodies are usually "
"made out of several pieces. The pieces are arranged and photographed once "
"for each frame of the film. The animator moves and rotates the parts in "
"small increments between each shot to create the illusion of movement when "
"the images are played back quickly in sequence."
