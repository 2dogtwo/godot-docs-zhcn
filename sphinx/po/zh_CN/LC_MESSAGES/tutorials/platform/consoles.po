"Register a developer account on the console manufacturer's website, then "

"Gain access to the publishing platform by passing the acceptance process. "
"This can take up to several months. Note that this step is significantly "
"easier if an established publisher is backing your game. Nintendo is "
"generally known to be more accepting of smaller developers, but this is not "
"guaranteed."

"To be published, your game needs to be rated in the regions you'd like to "
"sell it in. For example, in North America, the `ESRB <https://www.esrb.org/"
">`__ handles game ratings. In Europe, this is done by `PEGI <https://pegi."

"to more established developers."

"In practice, the process is quite similar to Unity and Unreal Engine, except "
"that you need to contact a third-party developer to handle the porting "
"process. In other words, there is no engine that is legally allowed to "
"distribute console export templates without requiring the user to prove that "
"they are a licensed console developer. Doing so would violate the console "
