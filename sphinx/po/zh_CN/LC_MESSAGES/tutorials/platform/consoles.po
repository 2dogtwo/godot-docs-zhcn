"Gain access to the publishing platform by passing the acceptance process. "

"In practice, the process is quite similar to Unity and Unreal Engine, except "
"that you need to contact a third-party developer to handle the porting "

"they are a licensed console developer. Doing so would violate the console "
"manufacturer's NDA."
