"The Godot Asset Library, otherwise known as the AssetLib, is a repository of "
"user-submitted Godot addons, scripts, tools and other resources, "
"collectively referred to as assets. They're available to all Godot users for "
"download directly from within the engine, but it can also be accessed at "
"Godot's `official website <https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset>`_."

"Godot资源馆，也称为AssetLib，是用户提交的Godot插件，脚本，工具和其他资源(统称"
"为资源)的存储库。 它们可供所有Godot用户直接从引擎内下载，或从Godot的 `官方网"
"站 <https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset>`_ 上下载。"

"On the surface, the Asset Library might look and function similar to asset "
"stores available for other engines, such as Unity's Asset Store, or Unreal "
"Engine's Marketplace, where you can submit both freely-available assets, as "
"well as paid, commercial ones. In addition, often times such assets are "
"distributed under non-free, proprietary licenses, limiting what you can do "
"with them."
msgstr ""
"从表面上看，资源馆的外观和功能类似于其他引擎的资源商店，例如Unity的资源商店或"
"虚幻引擎的市场，您可以在其中提交可自由使用的资源以及付费的商业资源。 此外，此"
"类资源通常在非自由的专有许可下分发，限制了您对它们的使用。"

"The Asset Library is different - all assets are distributed free of charge, "
"and under a host of open-source licenses (such as the MIT license, the GPL, "
"and the Boost Software License). This makes the AssetLib more similar to the "
"software repositories of a Linux distribution."
msgstr ""
"资源馆是不同的 - 所有资源都是免费分发的，并且服从多种开源许可证(例如MIT许可"
