msgid "Occluder Nodes"
msgstr "遮挡器节点"

msgid ""
"In addition to occlusion via :ref:`doc_rooms_and_portals`, Godot also has "
"the ability to provide basic occlusion using simple geometric ``Occluder`` "
"nodes. These are geometric shapes that are shown in the editor using gizmos, "
"but are invisible at runtime."
msgstr ""
"除了通过 :ref:`doc_rooms_and_portals` 实现遮挡外，Godot 还提供了使用简单几何 "
"``Occluder``\\ （遮挡器）节点进行简单遮挡的能力。这些几何体形状会在编辑器中以"
"控制器的形式显示，在运行时不可见。"

msgid ""
"Any object that is fully occluded by the shape (behind or in some cases "
"inside) will be culled at runtime. They are designed to be simple to use and "
"inexpensive at runtime, but the trade off is they may not be as effective at "
"culling as :ref:`doc_rooms_and_portals`. Nevertheless they can still "
"significantly boost performance in some situations."
msgstr ""
"完全被该形状遮挡（位于背部或内部）的对象在运行时会被剔除。它们是以简单易用、"
"不带来运行时负担为目的而设计的，但也因此可能没有 :ref:"
"`doc_rooms_and_portals` 高效。然而，在某些情况下仍然会带来显著的性能提升。"

msgid ""
"It is important to understand that geometric occluders work by testing the "
"axis aligned bounding box (``AABB``) of the occludee against the occluder. "
"The AABB must be *fully occluded* to be culled. The consequence of this is "
"that smaller objects are more likely to be effectively culled than larger "
"objects."
msgstr ""
"需要重点注意的是，几何体遮挡器的工作原理是检查遮挡器和被遮挡物体的轴对齐包围"
"盒（\\ ``AABB``\\ ）。AABB 被\\ *完全遮挡*\\ 才会进行剔除。因此，剔除较小的对"
"象比剔除较大的对象更高效。"

msgid ""
"A major advantage to Occluder nodes is that they are fully dynamic. For "
"example if you place an occluder node as a child of a spaceship, it will "
"move as you move the parent object."
msgstr ""
"Occluder 节点的主要优势在于它们是完全动态的。例如你为宇宙飞船添加了遮挡器子节"
"点，那么这个遮挡器就会跟随父对象移动。"

msgid ""
"The reason that Occluder nodes are so cheap in performance terms is that the "
"engine dynamically chooses the most relevant occluders at runtime, based on "
"the current viewpoint of the Camera. This means you can often have hundreds "
"of occluders present in the scene. Only the most relevant will be active at "
"any one time."
msgstr ""
"Occluder 节点之所以对性能影响那么小，是因为引擎在运行时会根据当前 Camera 的视"
"角动态选择最相关的遮挡器。也就是说, 你可以在一个场景里拥有上百个遮挡器，在同"
"一时间，只有那个最相关的会被激活。"

msgid ""
"The Occluder node itself is a holder for an OccluderShape resource, which "
"determines the functionality. To get started, add an Occluder node to your "
"scene tree."
msgstr ""
"Occluder 节点自身就是 OccluderShape 资源的持有者，功能顾名思义。首先，在你的"
"场景树中添加一个 Occluder 节点。"

msgid ""
"You will see a yellow warning triangle that lets you know that you must set "
"an OccluderShape from the inspector before the ``Occluder`` becomes "
"functional."
msgstr ""
"你会看到一个黄色的警告三角形，表示在 ``Occluder`` 可以生效之前，你必须在检查"
"器中为其设置一个 OccluderShape。"

msgid "OccluderShapeSphere"
msgstr "OccluderShapeSphere"

msgid ""
"The sphere is one of the simplest and fastest occluders, and is easy to "
"setup and position. The downside is that the sphere only tends to make sense "
"in certain game level designs, and is more suited to terrain or organic "
"background geometry."
msgstr ""
"球体是最简单快速的遮挡器之一，设置和摆放都很方便。缺点是球体往往只在特定的游"
"戏关卡设计中有意义，更适用于地形和有机背景几何体。"

msgid ""
"Once you have added an OccluderNode and chosen to add a new "
"``OccluderShapeSphere`` in the inspector, click the OccluderShapeSphere in "
"the inspector to bring up the parameters."
msgstr ""
"添加 OccluderNode 并在检查器中新建 ``OccluderShapeSphere`` 后，点击检查器中"
"的 OccluderShapeSphere 调出它的参数。"

msgid ""
"Unlike many Nodes, the ``OccluderShapeSphere`` can store multiple spheres in "
"the same object. This is more efficient in the engine, and keeps your "
"SceneTree clearer. You don't have to store all your spheres in one Occluder "
"as it could become tricky to manage, but it is perfectly reasonable to add "
"10 or so spheres or more. They are very cheap, and often the more you place, "
"the better the match you will get to your geometry."
msgstr ""
"与很多 Node 节点不同，\\ ``OccluderShapeSphere`` 可以在一个对象中存储多个球"
"体。在引擎中更高效，也能让你的 SceneTree 场景树更清爽。你不必把所有的球体都保"
"存在同一个 Occluder 里，管理起来会很麻烦，加 10 个左右的球体是比较合理的。这"
"些球体非常轻量，而且通常加得越多越能与几何体相匹配。"

msgid ""
"In order to store multiple spheres, they are stored as an Array. If you "
"click on the Array in the inspector, you can increase the size of the Array "
"to add one."
msgstr ""
"为了保存多个球体，它们会被存入 Array 数组。你可以在检查器中点击 Array，然后"
"把 Array 的大小增大，来添加一个球体。"

msgid ""
"The sphere will appear as a small pink spherical object in the editor "
"window. There are two handles on each sphere. The larger middle handle "
"enables you to move the sphere around in the local space of the Occluder, "
"and the small handle enables you to adjust the radius."
msgstr ""
"编辑器窗口中，这个球体会显示为一个小小的粉色圆形物体。每个球体有两个句柄。中"
"间较大的的句柄可以用来在 Occluder 的局部空间中移动球体，较小的句柄可以用来调"
"整半径。"

msgid ""
"Although you can change the position of the sphere using the Occluder Node "
"transform in the inspector, this moves *the entire array* of spheres. When "
"you want to use multiple spheres in one occluder, the handles do this job. "
"In order to allow positioning in 3D, the gizmo will only move the 3D "
"position in the two principal axes depending on the viewpoint in the editor. "
"This is easier for you to get the hang of by trying it out than by "
"explanation."
msgstr ""
"虽然你也可以通过在检查器中修改 Occluder 节点的变换属性来改变这个球体的位置，"
"但是这样就会移动\\ *数组中的所有*\\ 球体。如果你想在一个遮挡器中使用多个球"
"体，请使用那些句柄来调整位置。因为要支持 3D 空间中的定位，控制器会根据编辑器"
"的视点，只允许移动 3D 位置中的两个主轴。百闻不如一试。"

msgid ""
"There is one more handy function in the editor when using multiple spheres. "
"If you click the `Center Node` toolbar button it will recalculate the local "
"positions of the spheres relative to the average of the entire node, and "
"change the transform of the Occluder Node. This is a handy convenience "
"function to make it easier to place them."
msgstr ""
"使用多个球体时，编辑器还提供了一个便捷的功能。如果你单击工具栏上的\\ `居中节"
"点`\\ 按钮，就会重新计算这些球体相对于整个节点的局部位置，然后修改 Occluder "
"节点的变换。这个功能可以让排布小球变得更方便。"

msgid ""
"At runtime the spheres can be switched on and off changing the Occluder node "
"visibility, and the Node can be moved and scaled and rotated etc."
msgstr ""
"在运行时，你可以通过修改 Occluder 节点的可见性来开关这些球体，这个节点也能进"
"行移动、缩放、旋转等操作。"

msgid ""
"A common use case for occluder spheres is providing occlusion on "
"mountainous / hilly terrain. By placing spheres inside mountains you can "
"prevent trees, plants, building and objects rendering behind mountains. With "
"some creativity they can also be used for moving objects such as large "
"spacecraft, planets etc."
msgstr ""
"球体遮挡器的常见使用场景是为山体/丘陵地形提供遮挡。把球体放在山体内部，你就可"
"以防止渲染山背面的树木、植物、建筑、对象等内容。如果发挥想象力，还可以把它们"
"用于大型飞行器、星球等移动对象。"
