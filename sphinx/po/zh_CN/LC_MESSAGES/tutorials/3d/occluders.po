msgid "Occluder Nodes"
msgstr "遮挡器节点"

msgid ""
"In addition to occlusion via :ref:`doc_rooms_and_portals`, Godot also has "
"the ability to provide basic occlusion using simple geometric ``Occluder`` "
"nodes. These are geometric shapes that are shown in the editor using gizmos, "
"but are invisible at runtime."
msgstr ""
"除了通过 :ref:`doc_rooms_and_portals` 实现遮挡外，Godot 还提供了使用简单几何 "
"``Occluder``\\ （遮挡器）节点进行简单遮挡的能力。这些几何体形状会在编辑器中以"
"控制器的形式显示，在运行时不可见。"

msgid ""
"Any object that is fully occluded by the shape (behind or in some cases "
"inside) will be culled at runtime. They are designed to be simple to use and "
"inexpensive at runtime, but the trade off is they may not be as effective at "
"culling as :ref:`doc_rooms_and_portals`. Nevertheless they can still "
"significantly boost performance in some situations."
msgstr ""
"完全被该形状遮挡（位于背部或内部）的对象在运行时会被剔除。它们是以简单易用、"
"不带来运行时负担为目的而设计的，但也因此可能没有 :ref:"
"`doc_rooms_and_portals` 高效。然而，在某些情况下仍然会带来显著的性能提升。"

msgid ""
"It is important to understand that geometric occluders work by testing the "
"axis aligned bounding box (``AABB``) of the occludee against the occluder. "
"The AABB must be *fully occluded* to be culled. The consequence of this is "
"that smaller objects are more likely to be effectively culled than larger "
"objects."
msgstr ""
"需要重点注意的是，几何体遮挡器的工作原理是检查遮挡器和被遮挡物体的轴对齐包围"
"盒（\\ ``AABB``\\ ）。AABB 被\\ *完全遮挡*\\ 才会进行剔除。因此，剔除较小的对"
"象比剔除较大的对象更高效。"

msgid ""
"A major advantage to Occluder nodes is that they are fully dynamic. For "
"example if you place an occluder node as a child of a spaceship, it will "
"move as you move the parent object."
msgstr ""
"Occluder 节点的主要优势在于它们是完全动态的。例如你为宇宙飞船添加了遮挡器子节"
"点，那么这个遮挡器就会跟随父对象移动。"

msgid ""
"The reason that Occluder nodes are so cheap in performance terms is that the "
"engine dynamically chooses the most relevant occluders at runtime, based on "
"the current viewpoint of the Camera. This means you can often have hundreds "
"of occluders present in the scene. Only the most relevant will be active at "
"any one time."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The Occluder node itself is a holder for an OccluderShape resource, which "
"determines the functionality. To get started, add an Occluder node to your "
"scene tree."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You will see a yellow warning triangle that lets you know that you must set "
"an OccluderShape from the inspector before the ``Occluder`` becomes "
"functional."
msgstr ""

msgid "OccluderShapeSphere"
msgstr "OccluderShapeSphere"

msgid ""
"The sphere is one of the simplest and fastest occluders, and is easy to "
"setup and position. The downside is that the sphere only tends to make sense "
"in certain game level designs, and is more suited to terrain or organic "
"background geometry."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Once you have added an OccluderNode and chosen to add a new "
"``OccluderShapeSphere`` in the inspector, click the OccluderShapeSphere in "
"the inspector to bring up the parameters."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Unlike many Nodes, the ``OccluderShapeSphere`` can store multiple spheres in "
"the same object. This is more efficient in the engine, and keeps your "
"SceneTree clearer. You don't have to store all your spheres in one Occluder "
"as it could become tricky to manage, but it is perfectly reasonable to add "
"10 or so spheres or more. They are very cheap, and often the more you place, "
"the better the match you will get to your geometry."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"In order to store multiple spheres, they are stored as an Array. If you "
"click on the Array in the inspector, you can increase the size of the Array "
"to add one."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The sphere will appear as a small pink spherical object in the editor "
"window. There are two handles on each sphere. The larger middle handle "
"enables you to move the sphere around in the local space of the Occluder, "
"and the small handle enables you to adjust the radius."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Although you can change the position of the sphere using the Occluder Node "
"transform in the inspector, this moves *the entire array* of spheres. When "
"you want to use multiple spheres in one occluder, the handles do this job. "
"In order to allow positioning in 3D, the gizmo will only move the 3D "
"position in the two principal axes depending on the viewpoint in the editor. "
"This is easier for you to get the hang of by trying it out than by "
"explanation."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There is one more handy function in the editor when using multiple spheres. "
"If you click the `Center Node` toolbar button it will recalculate the local "
"positions of the spheres relative to the average of the entire node, and "
"change the transform of the Occluder Node. This is a handy convenience "
"function to make it easier to place them."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"At runtime the spheres can be switched on and off changing the Occluder node "
"visibility, and the Node can be moved and scaled and rotated etc."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"A common use case for occluder spheres is providing occlusion on "
"mountainous / hilly terrain. By placing spheres inside mountains you can "
"prevent trees, plants, building and objects rendering behind mountains. With "
"some creativity they can also be used for moving objects such as large "
"spacecraft, planets etc."
