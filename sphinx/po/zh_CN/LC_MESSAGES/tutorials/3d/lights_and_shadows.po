msgid ""
"When using the Forward+ renderer, Godot uses a *clustering* approach for "
"real-time lighting. As many lights as desired can be added (as long as "
"performance allows). However, there's still a default limit of 512 "
"*clustered elements* that can be present in the current camera view. A "
"clustered element is an omni light, a spot light, a :ref:`decal "

msgid ""
"When using the Compatibility renderer, up to 8 OmniLights + 8 SpotLights can "

"also be decreased to reduce shader compilation times and improve performance "
"slightly."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"With all rendering methods, up to 8 DirectionalLights can be visible at a "
"time. However, each additional DirectionalLight with shadows enabled will "
"reduce the effective shadow resolution of each DirectionalLight. This is "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If the rendering limit is exceeded, lights will start popping in and out "

"level geometry (which also improves culling efficiency)."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If you need to render more lights than possible in a given rendering "
"backend, consider using :ref:`baked lightmaps <doc_using_lightmap_gi>` with "

"**Blur:** Multiplies the shadow blur radius for this light. This works with "
"both traditional shadow mapping and contact-hardening shadows (lights with "
"**Angular Distance** or **Size** greater than ``0.0``). Higher values result "

"To compute shadow maps, the scene is rendered (only depth) from an "

"为了计算阴影贴图, 会从正交视图(仅深度)渲染整个场景(或直到最大距离). 但是, 这"
"种方法存在问题, 因为靠近相机的物体会得到块状阴影."

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"To fix this, a technique named *Parallel Split Shadow Maps* (PSSM) is used. "
"This splits the view frustum in 2 or 4 areas. Each area gets its own shadow "

"Each split distance is controlled relative to the camera far (or shadow "

"象提供更多细节(比如第三人称游戏中的角色)."

msgid ""
"Always make sure to set a shadow **Max Distance** according to what the "
"scene needs. A lower maximum distance will result in better-looking shadows "
"and better performance, as fewer objects will need to be included in shadow "
"rendering. You can also adjust **Fade Start** to control how aggressive the "
"shadow fade-out should be at a distance. For scenes where the **Max "
"Distance** fully covers the scene at any given camera position, you can "
"increase **Fade Start** to ``1.0`` to prevent the shadow from fading at a "
"distance. This should not be done in scenes where **Max Distance** doesn't "
"fully cover the scene, as the shadow will appear to be suddenly cut off at a "
"distance."
msgstr ""

"Sometimes, the transition between a split and the next can look bad. To fix "

"The **Shadow > Normal Bias** parameter can be used to fix special cases of "
