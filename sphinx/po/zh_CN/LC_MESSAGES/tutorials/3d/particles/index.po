"You can use particle systems to simulate complex physical effects like fire, "
"sparks, smoke, magical effects, and many more. They are very well suited for "
"creating dynamic and organic behavior and adding \"life\" to your scenes."

"The idea is that a particle is emitted at a fixed interval and with a fixed "
"lifetime. During its lifetime, every particle will have the same base "
"behavior. What makes each particle different from the others and creates the "
"organic look is the randomness that you can add to most of its parameters "
"and behaviors."
msgstr ""
"这个想法是以固定的间隔发射具有固定的寿命的 \"粒子\". 在其生命周期中, 每个粒子"
"都具有相同的基本行为. 让每个粒子变得不同并提供整体更加 \"有机\" 外观的是与各"
"个参数相关的 \"随机性\". 实质上, 创建粒子系统意味着设置基本物理参数, 然后为它"

"Every particle system you create in Godot consists of two main parts: "
"particles and emitters."

msgid ""
"A particle is the visible part of a particle system. It's what you see on "
"the screen when a particle system is active: The tiny specks of dust, the "
"flames of a fire, the glowing orbs of a magical effect. You can have "
"anywhere between a couple hundred and tens of thousands of particles in a "
"single system. You can randomize a particle's size, its speed and movement "
"direction, and change its color over the course of its lifetime. When you "
"think of a fire, you can think of all the little embers flying away from it "
"as individual particles."

msgid "Emitters"
msgstr "抖动"

msgid ""
"An emitter is what's creating the particles. Emitters are usually not "
"visible, but they can have a shape. That shape controls where and how "
"particles are spawned, for example whether they should fill a room like dust "
"or shoot away from a single point like a fountain. Going back to the fire "
"example, an emitter would be the heat at the center of the fire that creates "
"the embers and the flames."

msgid "All 3D particle nodes available in Godot"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There are two types of 3D particle systems in Godot: :ref:"
"`class_GPUParticles3D`, which are processed on the GPU, and :ref:"
"`class_CPUParticles3D`, which are processed on the CPU."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"CPU particle systems are less flexible than their GPU counterpart, but they "
"work on a wider range of hardware and provide better support for older "
"devices and mobile phones. Because they are processed on the CPU, they are "
"not as performant as GPU particle systems and can't render as many "
"individual particles."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"GPU particle systems run on the GPU and can render hundreds of thousands of "
"particles on modern hardware. You can write custom particle shaders for "
"them, which makes them very flexible. You can also make them interact with "
"the environment by using attractor and collision nodes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There are three particle attractor nodes: :ref:"
"`class_GPUParticlesAttractorBox3D`, :ref:"
"`class_GPUParticlesAttractorSphere3D`, and :ref:"
"`class_GPUParticlesAttractorVectorField3D`. An attractor node applies a "
"force to all particles in its reach and pulls them closer or pushes them "
"away based on the direction of that force."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"There are several particle collision nodes. :ref:"
"`class_GPUParticlesCollisionBox3D` and :ref:"
"`class_GPUParticlesCollisionSphere3D` are the simple ones. You can use them "
"to create basic shapes like boxes, a floor, or a wall that particles collide "
"with. The other two nodes provide more complex collision behavior. The :ref:"
"`class_GPUParticlesCollisionSDF3D` is useful when you want indoor scenes to "
"collide with particles without having to create all the individual box and "
"sphere colliders by hand. If you want particles to collide with large "
"outdoor scenes, you would use the :ref:"
"`class_GPUParticlesCollisionHeightField3D` node. It creates a heightmap of "
"your world and the objects in it and uses that for large-scale particle "
"collisions."
