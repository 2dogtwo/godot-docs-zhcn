"Your display outputs linear light ratios from some maximum to some minimum "

"The display has a limited range of intensity, depending on the display type. "
"The game engine renders to an unlimited range of intensity values, however. "
"While \"maximum intensity\" means something to an sRGB display, it has no "
"bearing in the game engine; there is only a potentially infinitely wide "
"range of intensity values generated per frame of rendering."

#: ../../docs/tutorials/3d/high_dynamic_range.rst:27
msgid ""
"This means that some transformation of the scene light intensity, also known "
"as _scene referred_ light ratios, need to be transformed and mapped to fit "
"within the particular output range of the chosen display. This can be most "
"easily understood if we consider virtually photographing our game engine "
"scene through a virtual camera. Here, our virtual camera would apply a "
"particular camera rendering transform to the scene data, and the output "
"would be ready for display on a particular display type."

"Almost all displays require a nonlinear encoding for the code values sent to "
"them. The display in turn, using its unique transfer characteristic, "

"blueish emission site."

"For a majority of computer displays, the specifications of the display are "
"outlined in accordance with IEC 61966-2-1, also known as the 1996 sRGB "
"specification. This specification outlines how an sRGB display is to behave, "
"including the color of the lights in the LED pixels as well as the transfer "
"characteristics of the input (OETF) and output (EOTF)."

"Not all displays use the same OETF and EOTF as a computer display however, "

"The mathematics of a scene referred model require that we multiply the scene "
"by different values to adjust the intensities and exposure to different "

"render the wider dynamic range of the game engine's scene output using the "
"simple transfer function of the display however, and therefore a more "
"complex approach to encoding is required."

"This is the easiest, but not the most ideal, method of using sRGB assets. "
