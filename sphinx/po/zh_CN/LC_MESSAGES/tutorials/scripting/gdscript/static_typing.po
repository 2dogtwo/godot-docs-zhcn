"With static typing, GDScript can detect more errors without even running the "
"code. Also type hints give you and your teammates more information as you're "

"有了GDScript中的类型,Godot在编写代码时甚至可以检测到更多错误！它会在你工作时"

"Overall, typed programming gives you a more structured experience. It helps "

"This is especially helpful when you're working in a team or on a long-term "
