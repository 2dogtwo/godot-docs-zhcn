msgid "Pausing games"
msgstr "暂停游戏"

msgid "Pause?"
msgstr "暂停？"

msgid ""
"In most games it is desirable to, at some point, interrupt the game to do "
"something else, such as taking a break or changing options. However, this is "
"not as simple as it seems. The game might be stopped, but it might be "
"desirable that some menus and animations continue working."
msgstr ""
"在大多数游戏中, 最好是在某些时候中断游戏, 做一些其他事情, 比如休息一下或改变"
"选项. 然而, 这并不像它看起来那么简单. 游戏可能被停止, 但可能希望一些菜单和动"
"画继续工作."

msgid ""
"Implementing a fine-grained control for what can be paused (and what can "
"not) is a lot of work, so a simple framework for pausing is provided in "
"Godot."
msgstr ""
"对可暂停(以及不可暂停)的内容实现细节控制需要大量工作, 因此Godot提供了一个简单"
"的暂停框架."

msgid "How pausing works"
msgstr "如何暂停工作"

msgid ""
"To set pause mode, the pause state must be set. This is done by assigning "
"``true`` to the :ref:`SceneTree.paused <class_SceneTree_property_paused>` "
"property:"
msgstr ""
"要设置暂停模式，必须设置暂停状态。将 :ref:`SceneTree.paused "
"<class_SceneTree_property_paused>` 属性赋值为 ``true`` 即可："

msgid "Doing so will have the following behavior:"
msgstr "这样做会产生以下行为:"

msgid "2D and 3D physics will be stopped."
msgstr "2D 和 3D 物理将被停止."

msgid ""
"``_process`` and ``_physics_process`` will not be called anymore in nodes."
msgstr "``_process`` 和 ``_physics_process`` 将不再会被节点调用."

msgid "``_input`` and ``_input_event`` will not be called anymore either."
msgstr "``_input`` 和 ``_input_event`` 也不再被调用."

msgid ""
"This effectively stops the whole game. Calling this function from a script, "
"by default, will result in an unrecoverable state (nothing will work "
"anymore!)."
msgstr ""
"这有效地阻止了整个游戏. 默认情况下, 从脚本调用此函数将导致不可恢复的状态(游戏"
"永久暂停！)."

msgid "White-listing nodes"
msgstr "白名单节点"

msgid ""
"Before enabling pause, make sure that nodes that must keep working during "
"pause are white-listed. This is done by editing the \"Pause Mode\" property "
"in a node:"
msgstr ""
"在启用暂停之前, 请确保在暂停期间必须继续工作的节点已列入白名单. 这是通过编辑"
"节点中的 ``暂停模式`` 属性来完成的:"

msgid "You can achieve the same result in code:"
msgstr "你可以在代码中实现同样的结果:"

msgid ""
"By default, all nodes have this property in the \"Inherit\" state. This "
"means, that they will only process (or not) depending on what this same "
"property is set on the parent node. If the parent is set to \"Inherit\" , "
"then the grandparent will be checked and so on. Ultimately, if a state can't "
"be found in any of the grandparents, the pause state in SceneTree is used. "
"This means that, by default, when the game is paused every node will be "
"paused."
msgstr ""
"默认情况下，所有节点的这个属性都是“Inherit（继承）”状态，也就是说，它们会根据"
"父节点上这个属性的取值来决定处理与否。如果父节点也是“Inherit”，那么就会去检查"
"祖父节点，以此类推。最终，如果祖宗们都没有更改过状态，那么就会使用 SceneTree "
"的暂停状态。也就是说，在游戏暂停时默认所有节点也都会被暂停下来。"

msgid "So the three possible states for a node are:"
msgstr "节点的三种可能状态有:"

msgid ""
"**Inherit**: Process depending on the state of the parent, grandparent, etc. "
"The first parent that has a non-Inherit state."
msgstr ""
"**Inherit（继承）** ：处理与否取决于父、祖父等等节点中第一个非 Inherit 状态的"
"节点。"

msgid ""
"**Stop**: Stop the node no matter what (and children in Inherit mode). When "
"paused this node will not process."
msgstr ""
"**Stop（停止）** ：无条件停止节点（以及 Inherit 模式的子节点）。暂停时该节点"
"不会进行处理。"

msgid ""
"**Process**: Process the node no matter what (and children in Inherit mode). "
"Paused or not this node will process."
msgstr ""
"**Process（处理）** ：无条件处理节点（以及 Inherit 模式的子节点）。无论暂停与"
"否，该节点都会进行处理。"

msgid "Example"
msgstr "示例"

msgid ""
"An example of this is creating a popup or panel with controls inside, and "
"set its pause mode to \"Process\" then hide it:"
msgstr ""
"一个示例是创建一个带有控件的弹出窗口或面板, 并将其暂停模式设置为 \"进程\" 然"
"后隐藏它:"

msgid ""
"Just by setting the root of the pause popup to \"Process\", all children and "
"grandchildren will inherit that state. This way, this branch of the scene "
"tree will continue working when paused."
msgstr ""
"只需设置暂停弹出窗口的根节点项为 \"Process\" , 所有子孙都将继承该状态. 这样, "
"场景树的这个分支将在暂停时继续工作."

msgid ""
"Finally, make it so when a pause button is pressed (any button will do), "
"enable the pause and show the pause screen."
msgstr "最后, 当按下暂停按钮(任何按钮都可以)时, 启用暂停并显示暂停屏幕."

msgid "To remove the pause, do the opposite when the pause screen is closed:"
msgstr "要删除暂停, 请在暂停屏幕关闭时执行相反操作:"

msgid "And that should be all!"
msgstr "就是这样, 喵！"
