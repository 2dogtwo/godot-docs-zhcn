"In most games it is desirable to, at some point, interrupt the game to do "
"something else, such as taking a break or changing options. Implementing a "
"fine-grained control for what can be paused (and what cannot) is a lot of "
"work, so a simple framework for pausing is provided in Godot."
msgstr ""
"对可暂停(以及不可暂停)的内容实现细节控制需要大量工作, 因此Godot提供了一个简单"
"的暂停框架."

"To pause the game the pause state must be set. This is done by assigning "
"``true`` to the :ref:`SceneTree.paused <class_SceneTree_property_paused>` "
"property:"
msgstr ""
"要设置暂停模式，必须设置暂停状态。将 :ref:`SceneTree.paused "
"<class_SceneTree_property_paused>` 属性赋值为 ``true`` 即可："

msgid ""
"Doing this will cause two things. First, 2D and 3D physics will be stopped "
"for all nodes. Second, the behavior of certain nodes will stop or start "
"depending on their process mode."

"The physics servers can be made active while the game is paused by using "
"their ``set_active`` methods."

msgid "Process Modes"
msgstr "处理顺序"

msgid ""
"Each node in Godot has a \"Pause Mode\" that defines when it processes. It "
"can be found and changed under a node's :ref:`Node <class_Node>` properties "
"in the inspector."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid "You can also alter the property with code:"
msgstr "你可以在代码中实现同样的结果:"

msgid "This is what each mode tells a node to do:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"**Inherit**: Process depending on the state of the parent, grandparent, etc. "
"The first parent that has a non-Inherit state."
msgstr ""
"**Inherit（继承）** ：处理与否取决于父、祖父等等节点中第一个非 Inherit 状态的"
"节点。"

msgid ""
"**Stop**: Stop the node no matter what (and children in Inherit mode). When "
"paused this node will not process."
msgstr ""
"**Stop（停止）** ：无条件停止节点（以及 Inherit 模式的子节点）。暂停时该节点"
"不会进行处理。"

msgid ""
"**Process**: Process the node no matter what (and children in Inherit mode). "
"Paused or not this node will process."
msgstr ""
"**Process（处理）** ：无条件处理节点（以及 Inherit 模式的子节点）。无论暂停与"
"否，该节点都会进行处理。"

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"By default, all nodes have this property in the \"Inherit\" state. If the "
"parent is set to \"Inherit\", then the grandparent will be checked and so "
"on. If a state can't be found in any of the grandparents, the pause state in "
"SceneTree is used. This means that, by default, when the game is paused "
"every node will be paused. Several things happen when a node stops "
"processing."
msgstr ""
"默认情况下，所有节点的这个属性都是“Inherit（继承）”状态，也就是说，它们会根据"
"父节点上这个属性的取值来决定处理与否。如果父节点也是“Inherit”，那么就会去检查"
"祖父节点，以此类推。最终，如果祖宗们都没有更改过状态，那么就会使用 SceneTree "
"的暂停状态。也就是说，在游戏暂停时默认所有节点也都会被暂停下来。"

msgid ""
"The ``_process``, ``_physics_process``, ``_input``, and ``_input_event`` "
"functions will not be called. However signals still work and cause their "
"connected function to run, even if that function's script is attached to a "
"node that has its pause mode set to \"Stop\"."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Animation nodes will pause their current animation, audio nodes will pause "
"their current audio stream, and particles will pause. These resume "
"automatically when the game is no longer paused."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"It is important to note that even if a node is processing while the game is "
"paused physics will **NOT** work for it by default. As stated earlier this "
"is because the physics servers are turned off. The physics servers can be "
"made active while the game is paused by using their ``set_active`` methods."

msgid "Pause Menu Example"
msgstr "暂停场景"

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"Here is an example of a pause menu. Create a popup or panel with controls "
"inside, and set its pause mode to \"Process\" then hide it. By setting the "
"root of the pause popup to \"Process\", all children and grandchildren will "
"inherit that state. This way, this branch of the scene tree will continue "
"working when paused."
msgstr ""
"只需设置暂停弹出窗口的根节点项为 \"Process\" , 所有子孙都将继承该状态. 这样, "
"场景树的这个分支将在暂停时继续工作."

msgid ""
"Finally, make it so when a pause button is pressed (any button will do), "
"enable the pause and show the pause screen."
msgstr "最后, 当按下暂停按钮(任何按钮都可以)时, 启用暂停并显示暂停屏幕."

msgid "To unpause, do the opposite when the pause screen is closed:"
msgstr "要删除暂停, 请在暂停屏幕关闭时执行相反操作:"
