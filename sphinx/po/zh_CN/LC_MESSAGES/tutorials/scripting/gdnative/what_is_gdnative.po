msgid "Introduction"
msgstr "前言"

msgid ""
"**GDNative** is a Godot-specific technology that lets the engine interact "
"with native `shared libraries <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"
"Library_(computing)#Shared_libraries>`__ at run-time. You can use it to run "
"native code without compiling it with the engine."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"GDNative is *not* a scripting language and has no relation to :ref:`GDScript "
"<doc_gdscript>`."

"You can use both GDNative and :ref:`C++ modules <doc_custom_modules_in_c++>` "
"to run C or C++ code in a Godot project."
msgstr ""
"支持将 :ref:`C++ 模块 <doc_custom_modules_in_c++>` 静态链接到引擎二进制文件"
"中."

msgid ""
"They also both allow you to integrate third-party libraries into Godot. The "
"one you should choose depends on your needs."

msgid "Advantages of GDNative"
msgstr "优势"

msgid ""
"Unlike modules, GDNative doesn't require compiling the engine's source code, "
"making it easier to distribute your work. It gives you access to most of the "
"API available to GDScript C#, allowing you to code game logic with full "
"control regarding performance. It's ideal if you need high-performance code "
"you'd like to distribute as an add-on in the :ref:`asset library "
"<doc_what_is_assetlib>`."
msgstr ""

msgid "Also:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"GDNative is not limited to C and C++. Thanks to :ref:`third-party bindings "
"<doc_what_is_gdnative_third_party_bindings>`, you can use it with many other "
"languages."
msgstr ""
"GDNative 并不仅限于 C 和 C++。得益于\\ :ref:`第三方绑定 "
"<doc_what_is_gdnative_third_party_bindings>`\\ ，你也可以在很多其他语言中使"
"用。"

msgid ""
"You can use the same compiled GDNative library in the editor and exported "
"project. With C++ modules, you have to recompile all the export templates "
"you plan to use if you require its functionality at run-time."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"GDNative only requires you to compile your library, not the whole engine. "
"That's unlike C++ modules, which are statically compiled into the engine. "
"Every time you change a module, you need to recompile the engine. Even with "
"incremental builds, this process is slower than using GDNative."
msgstr ""

msgid "Advantages of C++ modules"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"We recommend :ref:`C++ modules <doc_custom_modules_in_c++>` in cases where "
"GDNative isn't enough:"
msgstr ""
"如果 GDNative 无法满足要求，我们推荐使用 :ref:`C++ 模块 "
"<doc_custom_modules_in_c++>`\\ ："

msgid ""
"C++ modules provide deeper integration into the engine. GDNative's access is "
"limited to what the scripting API exposes."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"You can use C++ modules to provide additional features in a project without "
"carrying native library files around. This extends to exported projects."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"C++ modules are supported on all platforms. In contrast, GDNative isn't "
"supported on HTML5 and the Universal Windows Platform (UWP) yet."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"C++ modules can be faster than GDNative, especially when the code requires a "
"lot of communication through the scripting API."
msgstr ""

"The Godot developers officially support the following language bindings for "

"There are no plans to support additional languages with GDNative officially. "
"That said, the community offers several bindings for other languages (see "

msgstr ""
"没有官方支持更多 GDNative 语言的计划。不过社区提供了不少其他语言的绑定（见下"

"Not all bindings mentioned here may be production-ready. Make sure to "
"research options thoroughly before starting a project with one of those. "
"Also, double-check whether the binding is compatible with the Godot version "

"这里列出的绑定并不都能用于生产。请在新项目中使用前先做足调查。同时，请确定该"
