"**GDExtension** is a Godot-specific technology that lets the engine interact "
"with native `shared libraries <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/"
"Library_(computing)#Shared_libraries>`__ at run-time. You can use it to run "
"native code without compiling it with the engine."

"You can use both GDExtension and :ref:`C++ modules "

msgstr ""
"GDNative 和 :ref:`C++ 模块 <doc_custom_modules_in_c++>`\\ 都可以用于在 Godot "

"They also both allow you to integrate third-party libraries into Godot. The "
"one you should choose depends on your needs."
msgstr "它们都可以用来将第三方库集成进 Godot。选用哪一个取决于你的需求。"

"If you notice that specific systems are not accessible via GDExtension but "
"are via custom modules feel free to open an issue on the `godot-cpp "
"repository <https://github.com/godotengine/godot-cpp>`__ to discuss "

"Unlike modules, GDExtension doesn't require compiling the engine's source "
"code, making it easier to distribute your work. It gives you access to most "
"of the API available to GDScript and C#, allowing you to code game logic "
"with full control regarding performance. It's ideal if you need high-"
"performance code you'd like to distribute as an add-on in the :ref:`asset "
"library <doc_what_is_assetlib>`."
msgstr ""
"与模块不同，GDNative 不需要编译引擎的源码，可以使你的作品更易于分发。它可以让"
"你访问 GDScript、C# 使用的大多数 API，让你在编写游戏逻辑时能够完全控制性能。"
"这是你在\\ :ref:`资产库 <doc_what_is_assetlib>`\\ 中以插件形式分发高性能代码"
"的理想选择。"

"GDExtension is not limited to C and C++. Thanks to :ref:`third-party "
"bindings <doc_what_is_gdnative_third_party_bindings>`, you can use it with "
"many other languages."
msgstr ""
"GDNative 并不仅限于 C 和 C++。得益于\\ :ref:`第三方绑定 "

"You can use the same compiled GDExtension library in the editor and exported "
"project. With C++ modules, you have to recompile all the export templates "
"you plan to use if you require its functionality at run-time."
msgstr ""
"你可以在编辑器和导出项目中使用相同的编译后的 GDNative 库。而对于 C++ 模块，如"
"果你想在运行时使用相关功能，就必须重新编译所有想要使用的导出模板。"

msgid ""
"GDExtension only requires you to compile your library, not the whole engine. "
"That's unlike C++ modules, which are statically compiled into the engine. "
"Every time you change a module, you need to recompile the engine. Even with "
"incremental builds, this process is slower than using GDExtension."
msgstr ""
"GDNative 只需编译你自己的库，而不是整个引擎。C++ 模块则与此不同，是会静态编译"
"进引擎的。每修改一次模块，你就需要重新编译一次引擎。即使使用增量构建，这一过"
"程也比 GDNative 要慢。"

"We recommend :ref:`C++ modules <doc_custom_modules_in_cpp>` in cases where "

"C++ modules provide deeper integration into the engine. GDExtension's access "
"is not as deep as static modules"
msgstr "C++ 模块与引擎的集成更加紧密。GDNative 仅限于访问脚本所暴露的 API。"

msgid ""
"You can use C++ modules to provide additional features in a project without "
"carrying native library files around. This extends to exported projects."

"使用 C++ 模块为项目提供额外功能，就可以免去携带原生库文件的麻烦。同样也适用于"
