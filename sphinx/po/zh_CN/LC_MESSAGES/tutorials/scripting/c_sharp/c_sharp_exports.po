"In Godot, class members can be exported. This means their value gets saved "
"along with the resource (such as the :ref:`scene <class_PackedScene>`) "
"they're attached to. They will also be available for editing in the property "
"editor. Exporting is done by using the ``[Export]`` attribute."

"在 Godot 中可以导出类成员。这意味着它们的值会与它们所附加的资源（例如\\ :ref:"

"In that example the value ``5`` will be saved, and after building the "
"current project it will be visible in the property editor."

msgid ""
"One of the fundamental benefits of exporting member variables is to have "
"them visible and editable in the editor. This way, artists and game "
"designers can modify values that later influence how the program runs. For "
"this, a special export syntax is provided."
msgstr ""
"导出成员变量的基本好处之一，便是让这些变量在编辑器中可见可改，这样一来，美术"
"师和游戏设计师就可以修改这些会影响程序运行方式的值。为此，Godot 提供了一种特"

"Exporting can only be done with :ref:`Variant-compatible "
"<doc_c_sharp_variant>` types."
msgstr "导出只适用于\\ :ref:`与 Variant 兼容 <doc_c_sharp_variant>`\\ 的类型。"

msgid "Resources and nodes can be exported."
msgstr "可以导出资源和节点。"

msgid "Grouping exports"
msgstr "导出分组"

msgid ""
"It is possible to group your exported properties inside the Inspector with "
"the ``[ExportGroup]`` attribute. Every exported property after this "
"attribute will be added to the group. Start a new group or use "
"``[ExportGroup(\"\")]`` to break out."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"The second argument of the attribute can be used to only group properties "

"Groups cannot be nested, use ``[ExportSubgroup]`` to create subgroups within "
"a group."
msgstr "分组可以嵌套，请使用 ``[ExportSubgroup]`` 在分组中创建子分组。"

"You can also change the name of your main category, or create additional "
"categories in the property list with the ``[ExportCategory]`` attribute."

msgstr "字符串也能用作全局文件系统中某个目录的路径。"

msgid ""
"The multiline annotation tells the editor to show a large input field for "

msgstr ""
"多行文本注释会让编辑器使用大文本输入框来输入文本，而非那种小小的单行输入框。"
