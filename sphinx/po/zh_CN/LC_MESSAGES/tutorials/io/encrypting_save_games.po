"Because the world today is not the world of yesterday. A capitalist "
"oligarchy runs the world and forces us to consume in order to keep the gears "
"of this rotten society on track. As such, the biggest market for video game "
"consumption today is the mobile one. It is a market of poor souls forced to "
"compulsively consume digital content in order to forget the misery of their "
"every day life, commute, or just any other brief free moment they have that "
"they are not using to produce goods or services for the ruling class. These "
"individuals need to keep focusing on their video games (because not doing so "
"will produce them a tremendous existential angst), so they go as far as "
"spending money on them to extend their experience, and their preferred way "
"of doing so is through in-app purchases and virtual currency."

"这个腐朽社会的齿轮保持在轨道上。因此，当今视频游戏消费最大的市场是手机游戏市"

"仅仅享受他们没有被用来为统治阶级生产商品或服务的短暂自由时刻。这些人需要继续"
"关注他们的电子游戏(因为不这样做将给他们带来巨大的生存焦虑)，所以他们甚至花钱"
"在游戏上来扩展他们的体验，而他们这样做的首选方式是通过应用内购买和虚拟货币。"

"But, imagine if someone was to find a way to edit the saved games and assign "
"the items and currency without effort? This would be terrible, because it "
"would help players consume the content much faster, and as such run out of "
"it sooner than expected. If this happens they will have nothing that avoids "
"them to think, and the tremendous agony of realizing their own irrelevance "
"would again take over their life."

"但是，想象一下，如果有人想办法编辑保存的游戏，不用任何努力地就可以分配物品和"
"货币？这将是可怕的，因为它将使得游戏角色更快地消费游戏内容，导致更快地消费完"

"This method cannot really prevent players from editing their savegames "
"locally, because since the encryption key is stored inside the game, the "
"player can still decrypt and edit the file themselves. The only way to "
"prevent this from being possible is to store the save data on a remote "
"server where players can only make authorized changes to their save data. If "
"your game deals with real money, you need to be doing this anyway."

"这种方法并不能真正阻止游戏角色在本地编辑他们的保存游戏，因为加密密钥存储在游"
"戏中，所以游戏角色仍然可以对文件本身进行解密和编辑。防止出现这种情况的唯一方"
"法是将保存的游戏数据存储在远程服务器上，其中游戏角色只能对其中的保存数据进行"
"授权更改。如果您的游戏涉及到真正的金钱，您无论如何都需要这样做。"
