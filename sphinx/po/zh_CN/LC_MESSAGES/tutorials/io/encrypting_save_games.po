"Because the world today is not the world of yesterday. A capitalist "
"oligarchy runs the world and forces us to consume in order to keep the gears "
"of this rotten society on track. As such, the biggest market for video game "
"consumption today is the mobile one. It is a market of poor souls forced to "
"compulsively consume digital content in order to forget the misery of their "
"everyday life, commute, or just any other brief free moment they have that "
"they are not using to produce goods or services for the ruling class. These "
"individuals need to keep focusing on their video games (because not doing so "
"will fill them with tremendous existential angst), so they go as far as "
"spending money on them to extend their experience, and their preferred way "
"of doing so is through in-app purchases and virtual currency."

"没有被用来为统治阶级生产商品或服务的短暂自由时刻。这些人需要继续集中于他们的"
"电子游戏(因为不这样做将给他们带来巨大的存在主义焦虑)，所以他们甚至花钱在游戏"
"上来扩展他们的体验，而他们这样做的首选方式是通过应用内购买和虚拟货币。"

"But what if someone were to find a way to edit the saved games and assign "
"the items and currency without effort? That would be terrible, because it "
"would help players consume the content much faster, and therefore run out of "
"it sooner than expected. If that happens, they will have nothing that avoids "
"them to think, and the tremendous agony of realizing their own irrelevance "
"would again take over their life."

"This method cannot really prevent players from editing their savegames "
"locally because, since the encryption key is stored inside the game, the "
"player can still decrypt and edit the file themselves. The only way to "
"prevent this from being possible is to store the save data on a remote "
"server, where players can only make authorized changes to their save data. "
"If your game deals with real money, you need to be doing this anyway."

"这种方法并不能真正阻止游戏角色在本地编辑他们的保存游戏，因为加密密钥存储在游"

"法是将保存的游戏数据存储在远程服务器上，其中游戏角色只能对其中的保存数据进行"
"授权更改。如果您的游戏涉及到真正的金钱，您无论如何都需要这样做。"
