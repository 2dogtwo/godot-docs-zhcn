"This page explains how file paths work inside Godot projects. You will learn "
"how to access paths in your projects using the ``res://`` and ``user://`` "
"notations and where Godot stores user files on your hard-drive."

"To as many platforms as possible, Godot only accepts UNIX-style path "
"separators (``/``). These work on all platforms, including Windows."

"为了支持尽可能多的平台，Godot 只接受 UNIX 风格的路径分隔符（\\ ``/``\\ ）。所"

"Instead of writing paths like ``C:\\Projects``, in Godot, you should write "
"``C:/Projects``."

msgid ""
"Godot considers that a project exists in any folder that contains a "
"``project.godot`` text file, even if the file is empty. The folder that "
"contains this file is your project's root folder."
msgstr ""
"正如在\\ :ref:`doc_command_line_tutorial`\\ 中提到的，Godot 认为一个项目存在"
"于任何包含 ``project.godot`` 文本文件的指定文件夹中，即使该文件是空的。"

msgid ""
"You can access any file relative to it by writing paths starting with "
"``res://``, which stands for resources. For example, you can access an image "
"file ``character.png`` located in the project's root folder in code with the "
"following path: ``res://some_texture.png``."
msgstr ""
"访问项目文件可以通过打开以 ``res://`` 为基的任何路径来实现。例如，位于项目文"

msgid "Accessing persistent user data"
msgstr "访问场景节点"

msgid ""
"To store persistent data files, like the player's save or settings, you want "
"to use ``user://`` instead of ``res://`` as your path's prefix. This is "
"because when the game is running, the project's file system will likely be "
"read-only."
msgstr ""

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"The ``user://`` prefix points to a different directory on the user's device. "
"On mobile and consoles, this path is unique to the project. On desktop, the "
"engine stores user files in ``~/.local/share/godot/app_userdata/Name`` on "
"macOS and Linux, and ``%APPDATA%/Name`` on Windows. ``Name`` is based on the "
"application name defined in the Project Settings, but you can override it on "
"a per-platform basis using :ref:`feature tags <doc_feature_tags>`."
msgstr ""
"在某些设备(例如，移动设备和游戏机)上，对项目来说此路径是唯一的。 在桌面操作系"
"统上，引擎在macOS和Linux上使用典型的 ``~/.local/share/godot/app_userdata/"
"Name`` 路径，在Windows上使用 ``%APPDATA%/Name`` 路径来表示用户路径。 "
"``Name`` 取自项目设置中定义的应用程序名称，但它可被 :ref:`feature tags "
"<doc_feature_tags>` 命令覆写 。"
