#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"glTF binary files (``.glb``) are the smallest of the three options. They "
"include the mesh and textures set up in Blender. When brought into Godot the "
"textures are part of the object's material file."
msgstr ""
"二进制 glTF 文件是三个选项中最小的。包含在 Blender 中设置的网格和纹理。当放"

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"glTF embedded files (``.gltf``) function the same way as binary files. They "
"don't provide extra functionality in Godot, and shouldn't be used since they "
"have a larger file size."
msgstr ""
"嵌入式 glTF 文件的功能与二进制文件相同。没有在 Godot 中提供额外的功能，也不应"
"使用，因为它们的文件较大。"

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"There are two reasons to use glTF with the textures separate. One is to have "
"the scene description in a text based format and the binary data in a "
"separate binary file. This can be useful for version control if you want to "
"review changes in a text-based format. The second is you need the texture "
"files separate from the material file. If you don't need either of those, "
"glTF binary files are fine."
msgstr ""
"将 glTF 与纹理分开使用的原因有两个。一是将场景以基于文本的格式和二进制数据，"
"描述在单独的二进制文件中。这对于版本控制很有用，如果要基于文本格式评审更改。"
"二是您需要将纹理文件与材质文件分开。如果您不需要这些 glTF 二进制文件的任一"
"个，也可以。"

msgid ""
"The glTF import process first loads the glTF file's data into an in-memory "
"GLTFState class. This data is then used to generate a Godot scene. When "
"importing files at runtime, this scene can be directly added to the tree. "
"The export process is the reverse of this, a Godot scene is converted to a "
"GLTFState class, then the glTF file is generated from that."

"When importing glTF files in the editor, there are two more steps. After "
"generating the Godot scene, the ResourceImporterScene class is used to apply "
"additional import settings, including settings you set through the Import "
"dock and the Advanced Import Settings dialog. This is then saved as a Godot "
"scene file, which is what gets used when you run/export your game."

"If your model contains blend shapes (also known as \"shape keys\" and "

"Blender versions older than 3.2 do not export emissive textures with the "

"3.2 之前版本的 Blender 导出的 glTF 文件不会包含放射光纹理。如果您的模型使用这"
"种文字，并且你使用的是较旧版本的 Blender，则必须单独分开导入。"

msgid ""
"By default, Blender has backface culling disabled on materials and will "
"export materials to match how they render in Blender. This means that "
"materials in Godot will have their cull mode set to **Disabled**. This can "
"decrease performance since backfaces will be rendered, even when they are "
"being culled by other faces. To resolve this, enable **Backface Culling** in "
"Blender's Materials tab, then export the scene to glTF again."
msgstr ""
"默认情况下，Blender 在材质上禁用背面剔除，导出材质时匹配其在 Blender 中的渲染"
"方式。这意味着 Godot 中的材质会将其剔除模式设置为 **Disabled**\\ 。这会降低性"
"能，因为背面将被渲染，即使它们不可见。要解决此问题，请在 Blender 的材质选项卡"
"中启用 **Backface Culling** ，然后再次将场景导出为 glTF。"

"It is **strongly** recommended to use an official Blender release downloaded "

"This allows you to iterate on your 3D scenes faster, as you can save the "

"To use ``.blend`` import, you must install Blender before opening the Godot "
"editor (if opening a project that already contains ``.blend`` files). If you "
