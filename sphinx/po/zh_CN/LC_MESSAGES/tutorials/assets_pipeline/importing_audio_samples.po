msgstr "Godot 提供了三个选项来导入您的音频数据：WAV、Ogg Vorbis、MP3。"

msgid "Each format has different advantages:"
msgstr "不同的格式各有优点："

msgid ""
"WAV files use raw data or light compression (IMA-ADPCM). They are "
"lightweight on the CPU to play back (hundreds of simultaneous voices in this "
"format are fine). The downside is that they take up a lot of disk space."
msgstr ""
"WAV 文件使用原始数据或轻度压缩（IMA-ADPCM）。播放这种格式的 CPU 开销很小（同"
"时播放上千个都没问题）。缺点是会占用大量的磁盘空间。"

msgid ""
"Ogg Vorbis files use a stronger compression that results in much smaller "
"file size, but require significantly more processing power to play back."
msgstr ""
"Ogg Vorbis 文件使用更强的压缩，因此文件更小，但需要更多的处理能力才能播放。"

#, fuzzy
msgid ""
"MP3 files use better compression than WAV with IMA-ADPCM, but worse than Ogg "
"Vorbis. This means that a MP3 file with roughly equal quality to Ogg Vorbis "
"will be significantly larger. On the bright side, MP3 requires less CPU "
"usage to play back compared to Ogg Vorbis."
msgstr ""
"MP3 文件的压缩比的 WAV 的 IMA-ADPCM 好，但比 Ogg Vorbis 差。这意味着，一个与 "
"Ogg Vorbis 质量大致相同的 MP3 文件明显更大。从好的方面来看，与 Ogg Vorbis 相"
"比，MP3 在播放时需要使用更少的 CPU。这使得 MP3 对于 CPU 资源有限的移动端和 "
"HTML5 项目非常有用，特别是在同时播放多个压缩过的声音时（如长的环境音）。"
