"The :ref:`Class reference <doc_class_reference>` is a set of articles "
"describing the public API of the engine. This includes descriptions for "
"various classes, methods, properties, and global objects, available for "
"scripting. The class reference is available online, from the documentation "
"sidebar, and in the Godot editor, from the help menu."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"As the engine grows and features are added or modified, some parts of the "
"class reference become obsolete and new descriptions and examples need to be "
"added. While developers are encouraged to document all of their work in the "
"class reference when submitting a pull request, we can't expect everyone to "
"be able to write high quality documentation, so there is always work for "
"contributors like you to polish existing and create missing reference "
"material."

"As the class reference is available in two places, online and in the editor, "
"we need to take care to keep things in sync. To achieve this the `main Godot "
"repository <https://github.com/godotengine/godot/>`_ is picked as the source "
"of truth, and the documentation for the class reference is tracked there."
msgstr ""
"因为参考是包含在 Godot 编辑器中的，它的源文件是 `Godot 仓库 <https://github."
"com/godotengine/godot>`_\\ 的一部分。我们是用 XML 文件来编写的，所以贡献类参"
"考的流程和编写在线手册的流程有所不同。"

"You should **not** edit ``.rst`` files in the ``classes/`` folder of the "
"`documentation repository <https://github.com/godotengine/godot-docs/>`_. "
"These files are generated automatically and are synced manually by project "
"maintainers. Read further to learn how to correctly edit the class reference."

"In the main repository the class reference is stored in XML files, one for "
"each exposed class or global object. The majority of these files is located "
"in `doc/classes/ <https://github.com/godotengine/godot/tree/master/doc/"
"classes>`_, but some modules contain their own documentation as well. You "
"will find it in the ``modules/<module_name>/doc_classes/`` directory. To "

msgstr "贡献方式"

msgid ""
"The natural place to start contributing is the classes that you are most "
"familiar with. This ensures that the added description will be based on "
"experience and the necessary know-how, not just the name of a method or a "
"property. We advise not to add low effort descriptions, no matter how "
"appealing it may look. Such descriptions obscure the need for documentation "
"and are hard to identify automatically."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Following this principle is important and allows us to create tools for "
"contributors. Such as the class reference's `completion status tracker "
"<https://godotengine.github.io/doc-status/>`_. You can use it to quickly "
"find documentation pages missing descriptions."

"If you decide to document a class, but don't know what a particular method "
"does, don't worry. Leave it for now, and list the methods you skipped when "
"you open a pull request with your changes. Another writer will take care of "
"it."
msgstr ""
"没问题. 将其留下, 并在你请求提取更改时列出跳过的方法. 别的编写者会处理它."

"You can still look at the methods' implementation in Godot's source code on "

"Unless you make minor changes, like fixing a typo, we do not recommend using "
"the GitHub web editor to edit the class reference's XML files. It lacks "
"features to edit XML well, like keeping indentations consistent, and it does "
"not allow amending commits based on reviews."

"除非你只需要做一些微小的修改，比如修正一个拼写错误，否则我们不建议你使用 "

"To do so, you first need to compile Godot. See the :ref:"
