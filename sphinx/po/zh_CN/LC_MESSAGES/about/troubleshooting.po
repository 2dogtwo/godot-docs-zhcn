"The editor runs slowly and uses all my CPU and GPU resources, making my "
"computer noisy"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is a known issue, especially on macOS since most Macs have Retina "
"displays. Due to Retina displays' higher pixel density, everything has to be "
"rendered at a higher resolution. This increases the load on the GPU and "
"decreases perceived performance."

"In 3D, click the **Perspective** button in the top left corner and enable "
"**Half Resolution**. The 3D viewport will now be rendered at half "
"resolution, which can be up to 4 times faster."

"Open the Editor Settings and increase the value of **Low Processor Mode "
"Sleep (µsec)** to ``33000`` (30 FPS). This value determines the amount of "
"*microseconds* between frames to render. Higher values will make the editor "

"If you have a node that causes the editor to redraw continuously (such as "
"particles), hide it and show it using a script in the ``_ready()`` method. "
"This way, it will be hidden in the editor but will still be visible in the "

"The editor stutters and flickers on my variable refresh rate monitor (G-Sync/"
"FreeSync)"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"This is a `known issue <https://github.com/godotengine/godot/"
"issues/38219>`__. Variable refresh rate monitors need to adjust their gamma "
"curves continuously to emit a consistent amount of light over time. This can "
"cause flicker to appear in dark areas of the image when the refresh rate "
"varies a lot, which occurs as the Godot editor only redraws when necessary."
msgstr ""

msgid "There are several workarounds for this:"
msgstr "这有几个原因："

msgid ""
"Enable **Interface > Editor > Update Continuously** in the Editor Settings. "
"Keep in mind this will increase power usage and heat/noise emissions since "
"the editor will now be rendering constantly, even if nothing has changed on "
"screen. To alleviate this, you can increase **Low Processor Mode Sleep "
"(µsec)** to ``33000`` (30 FPS) in the Editor Settings. This value determines "
"the amount of *microseconds* between frames to render. Higher values will "
"make the editor feel less reactive but will help decrease CPU and GPU usage "
"significantly."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Alternatively, disable variable refresh rate on your monitor or in the "
"graphics driver."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"VRR flicker can be reduced on some displays using the **VRR Control** or "
"**Fine Tune Dark Areas** options in your monitor's OSD. These options may "
"increase input lag or result in crushed blacks."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If using an OLED display, use the **Black (OLED)** editor theme preset in "
"the Editor Settings. This hides VRR flicker thanks to OLED's perfect black "
"levels."

msgstr "此编辑器或项目花了很长时间才启动。"

msgid ""
"When using one of the Vulkan-based renderers (Forward+ or Forward Mobile), "
"the first startup is expected to be relatively long. This is because shaders "

"If the issue persists after the first startup, this is a `known bug <https://"

"specific USB peripherals connected. In particular, Corsair's iCUE software "
"seems to cause this bug. Try updating your USB peripherals' drivers to their "

msgid ""
"This is due to a design limitation of the macOS dock. The only known way to "
"resolve this would be to merge the project manager and editor into a single "
"process, which means the project manager would no longer spawn a separate "
"process when starting the editor. While using a single process instance "
"would bring several benefits, it isn't planned to be done in the near future "

"disable HDR in the Windows settings when not running applications that use "
"HDR output. On Windows 11, this can be done by pressing :kbd:`Windows + Alt "
"+ B` (this shortcut is part of the Xbox Game Bar app). To toggle HDR "

"The project works when run from the editor, but fails to load some files "

msgstr "项目在编辑器中正常运行，但在导出后无法加载部分文件。"

msgid ""
"This is usually caused by forgetting to specify a filter for non-resource "
"files in the Export dialog. By default, Godot will only include actual "
"*resources* into the PCK file. Some files commonly used, such as JSON files, "
"are not considered resources. For example, if you load ``test.json`` in the "
"exported project, you need to specify ``*.json`` in the non-resource export "
"filter. See :ref:`doc_exporting_projects_export_mode` for more information."
msgstr ""
"这通常是在导出对话框中忘记筛选非资源文件所导致的。默认情况下，Godot只会将实际"

"指定 ``*.json``\\ 。详见：\\ :ref:`doc_exporting_projects_export_mode`\\ 。"

"导出的项目永远不会包含名字以点开头的文件和文件夹。这是为了防止将 ``.git`` 等"

msgid ""
"On Windows, this can also be due to :ref:`case sensitivity "
"<doc_project_organization_case_sensitivity>` issues. If you reference a "
"resource in your script with a different case than on the filesystem, "
"loading will fail once you export the project. This is because the virtual "
"PCK filesystem is case-sensitive, while Windows's filesystem is case-"
"insensitive by default."
msgstr ""
"在 Windows 上，也可能是\\ :ref:`大小写敏感性 "
"<doc_project_organization_case_sensitivity>`\\ 的问题。如果你在脚本里引用资源"
"时所使用的大小写与文件系统中的不符，在导出项目后就会载入失败。这是因为虚拟 "
