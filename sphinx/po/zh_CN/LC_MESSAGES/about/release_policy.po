msgstr ""
"``major``\\ （主要）版本在发生重大不兼容时会增加，这意味着项目需要大量的移植"

"This is because Godot, as a game engine, covers many areas like rendering, "

"might sometimes require changing a feature's behavior or modifying a class's "

"因此，建议所有用户升级到新的次要版本，但有必要进行一些测试，以确保你的项目在"
"新的次要版本中仍能按照预期的方式运行。"

"fixing bugs and security issues, implementing new requirements for platform "
"support, and backporting safe usability enhancements. Patch releases are "
"backwards compatible."
msgstr ""
"``patch``\\ （补丁）版本是为维护版本而增加的，其重点是修复错误和安全问题，实"

"recommend keeping :ref:`doc_upgrading_to_godot_4` open in a separate tab to "

msgid ""
"The general recommendation is to upgrade your project to follow new *patch* "
"releases, such as upgrading from 4.0.2 to 4.0.3. This ensures you get bug "
"fixes, security updates and platform support updates (which is especially "
"important for mobile platforms). You also get continued support, as only the "
"last patch release receives support on official community platforms."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"For *minor* releases, you should determine whether it's a good idea to "
"upgrade on a case-by-case basis. We've made a lot of effort in making the "
"upgrade process as seamless as possible, but some breaking changes may be "
"present in minor releases, along with a greater risk of regressions. Some "
"fixes included in minor releases may also change a class' expected behavior "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"*Major* releases bring a lot of new functionality, but they also remove "
"previously existing functionality and may raise hardware requirements. They "
"also require much more work to upgrade to compared to minor releases. As a "
"result, we recommend sticking with the major release you've started your "
"project with if you are happy with how your project currently works. For "
"example, if your project was started with 3.5, we recommend upgrading to "
"3.5.2 and possibly 3.6 in the future, but not to 4.0+, unless your project "
"really needs the new features that come with 4.0+."
