"The first are our units. In normal 3D games, you don't have to think a lot "
"about units. As long as everything is at the same scale, a box sized 1 unit "
"by 1 unit by 1 unit can be any size from a cube you can hold in your hand to "
"something the size of a building. In AR and VR, this changes because things "
"in your virtual world are mapped to things in the real world. If you step 1 "
"meter forward in the real world, but you only move 1 cm forward in your "
"virtual world, you have a problem. The same with the position of your "
"controllers; if they don't appear in the right relative space, it breaks the "
"immersion for the player. Most VR platforms, including our AR/VR Server, "
"assume that 1 unit = 1 meter. The AR/VR server, however, has a property "
"that, for convenience, is also exposed on the ARVROrigin node called world "
"scale. For instance, setting this to a value of 10 changes our coordinate "
"system so 10 units = 1 meter."

"The high FOV and related lens distortion effect require many VR experiences "
