"The first are our units. In normal 3D games you don't have to think a lot "
"about units. As long as everything is at the same scale a box sized 1 unit "
"by 1 unit by 1 unit can be any size from a cube you can hold in your hand to "
"something the size of a building. In AR and VR this changes because things "
"in your virtual world are mapped to things in the real world. If you step 1 "
"meter forward in the real world, but you only move 1 cm forward in your "
"virtual world, you have a problem. The same with the position of your "
"controllers, if they don't appear in the right relative space it breaks the "
"immersion for the player. Most VR platforms including our AR/VR Server "
"assumes that 1 unit = 1 meter. The AR/VR server however has a property that "
"for convenience is also exposed on the ARVROrigin node called world scale. "
"For instance setting this to a value of 10 it changes our coordinate system "
"so 10 units = 1 meter."
